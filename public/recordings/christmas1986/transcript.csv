8.66|18.13|... I'm going to write you a letter and put it in with these tapes.
18.25|24.75|And then I thought, well, I might as well talk to you for a while on this other tape instead of writing a letter.
27.32|33.45|This is November the 28th, Thursday, November the 28th.
34.77|42.78|And the Phyllis has the parcels ready to ship -- Christmas parcels ready to ship to Toronto, 
45.88|49.94|and Janey, and Calgary, I presume.
50.06|52.1|No, Calgary, they'll be down here.
52.2|53.2|They'll pick theirs up here.
55.16|57.16|Anyway, everything's going fine here.
57.46|59.62|We've got nice weather now the last three, four days.
63.18|67.28|I've been doing some work on my water softener.
67.32|70.98|The valve -- shut off valve on the water line.
71.1|72.48|It wouldn't shut off anymore.
72.86|74.2|It was all corroded.
75.7|82.84|And the one going into the pan on the humidifier has been leaking.
82.88|84.7|And I couldn't get it adjusted.
84.92|89.32|So I'm putting in a new valve, a new float valve.
90.36|94.74|Believe it or not, the little plastic thing, $12.75.
97.0|100.18|And I don't know how long it'll last.
100.24|103.0|The other one lasts about five, six years.
103.1|104.9|And then the orifice goes on them.
105.7|110.26|And you could put a new rubber gasket in, but it won't shut the water off.
111.84|114.86|And I had to run around and pick up the parts.
115.18|117.66|You've got to go here and you've got to go there.
117.76|120.66|One guy has one thing and the next guy has the other thing.
120.8|126.3|And between the two shopping malls here, I've been able to gather up the stuff I need.
126.68|129.58|And what else am I doing?
129.62|136.76|Yeah, I'm going to put a plastic, a stiff plastic cover in front of the
137.5|137.9|fireplace.
137.98|139.38|I've done some testing.
139.5|143.3|I put cardboard in there back when it was so cold.
143.38|145.08|What a difference it made in this familyroom.
145.8|149.42|You can't imagine the cold air that came out through that fireplace.
150.6|151.66|It's not a draft.
151.82|153.86|It's just a continuous cold coming in.
154.66|157.22|I put a cardboard in there and shut it all off tight
157.34|161.94|and you could sit in here and it was, 10, 15 below zero.
162.66|164.62|And your feet were nice and warm.
164.7|167.48|Where before that, just sit in here and your feet were always cold.
169.18|171.04|I talked to George the other day.
173.88|181.98|He phoned me, oh ya to tell me that he had been to the annual meeting of the Elks
181.98|185.5|where they give out their pins for the years.
185.58|190.6|Next year, I'm up for my 45th year as an Elk.
191.74|198.08|George is coming into his 50th in a year or so.
200.68|201.84|He's keeping fine.
202.48|203.36|Sounded good.
205.04|206.8|Said he had been talking to you guys.
210.12|212.7|I better check on this; see if it's taping properly.
213.62|215.04|Yeah, it seemed to be taping,
215.06|218.9|so all I have to do is lay back in the lazy boy here and talk.
221.54|224.58|If I can think of what to say, it's, you know,
224.64|227.72|unless you have some special topic to talk on,
227.78|230.64|it's pretty hard to keep on a continuous conversation.
233.74|236.2|I'm getting quite a kick out of all
236.2|238.34|the "bad news".
239.48|241.6|You never hear anything good on TV,
241.88|242.78|it's always bad.
243.82|246.36|Poor Reagan, he's into it up to his knees.
248.18|252.14|And I don't think our boys in Ottawa are much better.
252.26|256.52|They're trying to patch up here and patch up there
256.52|258.98|to make it look good but oh boy.
260.66|264.1|The old dept keeps on piling up, piling up.
265.04|267.76|Sinclair Stevens is having a hell of a time.
268.14|272.14|I laugh at when they're at the coffee roll.
272.26|274.32|I say, they shouldn't be so hard on that guy,
274.52|276.84|you know, I shook hands with him about 20 years ago
276.84|278.58|and he's a pretty nice fella.
280.36|282.08|You probably don't know that.
282.16|286.66|It was at the time that I was a signer for the Western Bank of Canada
286.66|291.42|that Stevens and Klein were going to start up.
291.88|294.52|And they were down here and had a meeting
295.84|300.52|in the Saskatchewan Hotel.
301.46|306.3|And all of us that were signers for were invited there.
307.0|308.88|You know, just to hear them talk.
309.1|312.02|But it's in the end, they never start the bank.
312.14|314.08|They got squabbling amongst themselves
314.08|316.34|who is going to control it.
316.44|317.54|And that's where it stopped.
318.22|321.42|But right now, it seems that Stevens has got himself
321.42|324.42|into plenty of a mess.
325.84|331.6|If what you can go by what you see here on TV.
331.8|335.3|It looks pretty rotten.
340.14|343.04|And that both him and his wife are just sitting there
343.04|344.88|telling one bit after the other.
346.08|347.3|Deny, deny, deny.
348.56|354.68|The fella that loaned her, what, 2.6 million
354.68|356.64|without knowing who she was.
356.7|357.26|Yeah.
358.08|361.6|I think he was lying a little bit, too.
362.9|364.92|However, that's all past -- let'er go.
366.06|368.6|Right today on the news, it came over -
369.08|370.7|you talk about bad news -
371.84|375.4|and the news for this morning, I heard that there was
375.4|380.08|a policeman in Calgary that had robbed 20,
380.26|383.14|had staged 20 bank holdups in Calgary
383.14|384.4|in the last couple of years.
385.34|386.44|He's a policeman.
386.86|388.06|33 years ago.
388.08|393.32|Father of a family of seven, and a very unassuming guy.
393.58|397.8|And I don't know how they got suspicious, but they,
398.42|401.82|I guess they followed him after hours or something
401.82|407.14|and caught him in the act and tagged 20 robberies
407.14|407.64|off to him.
409.12|412.72|Whether he was responsible for all of them, I don't know.
414.22|415.62|That's some more bad news.
418.06|420.28|The first minister's meeting in Vancouver,
422.82|424.3|I listened to it for nine hours, one day
424.42|428.6|and everyone they all did a magnificent job of presenting their case.
429.84|432.94|But each one ended up the next day,
433.0|435.12|then holding his hand out, give us some money,
435.18|438.18|give us some money, we need this, we need money to do that.
438.84|441.38|Well, Rudy said, God, fellas, I'm trying to hold
441.54|445.18|the line, he said, "There's got to be and end to handouts."
447.28|448.9|However, in some ways, somehow,
449.34|451.54|they're all keeping it going, keep on rolling.
456.54|464.77|Then, oh, yeah, I was talking to Hugo the other day,
464.83|467.77|stopped in there for coffee in the morning
467.77|468.97|when I was out for a walk.
472.24|473.8|He's keeping fine.
474.12|475.74|Always mad at the government.
476.2|478.22|He said "Their all a bunch of crooks."
480.06|487.72|Then he said, was in Vancouver trying to negotiate a deal for.
487.72|494.5|some of these -- one of these machines that makes steel bins.
496.74|500.3|And they had some complicated deal that he had a chance
500.3|505.42|to buy $15,000 worth of steel for $9,000.
506.24|509.7|But he couldn't find anybody that needed a bin.
509.92|514.58|So I guess that's put on the back burner.
515.32|518.86|Other than that, he didn't have anything to say about Denny.
518.86|522.66|And the farmers here are suffering.
522.84|524.46|Of course, they holler like hell.
524.58|525.6|It always was that way.
525.66|528.52|Farming was always a tough deal in Saskatchewan.
528.62|531.64|My God, I remember when I was home on the farm,
531.74|534.7|the years that you went through hardly
534.78|537.38|got enough to pull you through.
537.6|539.5|But Dad never asked for anything.
539.7|541.84|We never got 5 cents from the government.
542.14|543.98|Dad worked for 17 years.
545.06|549.08|And they never went to the municipality or anybody to get seed
549.08|550.42|or help or anything.
550.72|552.52|They always stayed on top of the pile.
552.7|558.0|Of course, he had a lot of the manpower around there to help,
558.24|559.42|I suppose that didn't hurt any.
559.92|561.7|Although there were other families around there
561.74|565.86|with just as big a family as we had that never made it through at all.
568.31|571.63|After five, six years, they'd pull it up and head back to the States
571.63|572.33|where they came from.
573.73|575.13|That's the last you'd hear of them.
577.37|580.41|But farmers, sure, they're not going to make it big.
580.41|583.73|Those that brought land at $400, $500, $600 an acre,
584.53|585.73|they're in trouble.
586.01|587.17|There's no question about it.
587.25|593.99|You can't pay that for land and then sell wheat for $2.50 or $3 a bushel.
594.37|596.47|Right now, a lot of this grain,
597.31|601.71|where they have the big, heavy crop, particularly in the Regina area here,
601.77|603.35|if they didn't get it off before the rain,
603.57|607.15|it's going to go for about grade 4, 5 or feed.
607.69|610.05|And they only get a couple dollars a bushel for it.
610.07|610.35|Well...
610.89|612.93|that doesn't count up very fast.
613.17|614.89|Those that got theirs off first,
615.03|618.03|I guess they get about better than $3 a bushel.
618.45|621.71|But their quota's only 2.9 bushels to the acre,
621.81|625.71|so they can only sell enough to pay the gas bill,
625.75|626.49|and that's about all.
628.48|631.4|The banker and the implement company will have to wait.
636.55|641.81|Yesterday, Don Horstman, one of my Rummy friends,
644.49|646.29|picked me up and we went out for coffee.
648.43|652.53|The Rummy games haven't been going on for about 3 months now.
652.71|656.79|Bill Harkson, one of the stable, steady guys,
656.97|659.69|he's got vision problems the same as I have.
659.87|661.55|We're both about equal visually.
663.13|665.89|He's been in the hospital for almost 3 months now.
666.33|672.19|He just had -- he's 81 years old, and he just had a stomach operation,
673.23|674.91|and his kidneys are gone.
674.91|677.35|He's in a hell of a shape.
677.39|678.95|He told me a month ago, he said,
678.99|680.01|"I'll never get out of here."
680.21|681.87|He could be right,
683.31|684.95|but he's in a pretty bad shape.
685.37|688.75|He's pouring blood into him, and keep him going.
689.49|691.03|I'm going up to see him this afternoon.
691.15|692.43|He's been in intensive care.
692.57|694.89|I haven't seen him now for about 8 days.
697.65|699.45|Well, I have a chat with him -
700.07|701.49|it's hard to miss with a guy,
701.57|703.27|when he's been laying in bed like that.
703.63|705.07|You know, they lose interest.
705.07|707.49|Doesn't have TV or radio or anything.
708.05|713.19|They sort of lose interest in what's going on in the outside world.
715.91|718.11|And what else could I say...
719.65|725.39|Oh, I guess we told you that Alan Akin,
725.53|727.47|Mac's wife, passed away.
727.57|728.67|Yes, we told you that.
730.76|734.36|And I was talking to Ethel.
735.04|738.0|At that time, I phoned Ethel to let her know about it.
738.0|740.68|She's keeping fine up in Edmonton.
742.58|744.88|Jimmy Lawrence getting married is, you know,
744.98|746.02|on the 6th of December.
746.02|749.46|You'll probably have an announcement.
750.04|752.04|He wasn't sending out invitations.
752.42|756.52|He said, "We didn't expect you guys to come that far to
757.2|759.72|just spend an afternoon at a wedding."
761.08|763.2|And he did the same with us.
763.3|766.66|He said, "I don't expect you people to come up."
766.68|767.34|He said, it's...
767.34|769.0|A lot of fuss for -
770.81|773.17|and this time of the year, and the weather's so uncertain,
773.31|776.09|I don't think that Wally and Willa are going up.
778.89|780.89|If anything, Wally may go.
782.47|784.77|But Willa, she settled down there.
784.87|787.41|She'd be feeling pretty good since she got back down there.
788.07|791.31|She was not in very good shape the last time she was up here,
791.51|793.61|which was just before the end of October.
795.79|796.75|She was...
798.25|799.71|Not herself at all.
799.93|803.61|She was thin and uninterested and hard to converse with.
805.11|807.69|But now, we talked to her on the phone the other night
807.69|810.73|on Wally's birthday, which was on the 17th of November.
811.39|812.97|She sounded really good.
813.05|814.71|She said she was feeling good, too.
819.64|822.6|And, oh, yeah, the big city of Halbrite got on the news
823.24|824.54|night before last.
826.8|831.32|The guy that delivers mail from here down to Weyburn
831.32|833.58|and all the towns along the line,
833.58|836.58|to Estevan and I don't know how far beyond.
836.98|840.06|But when he's at Halbrite about 5 o'clock in the morning,
840.48|847.96|I guess he must have a key to put the mail bags in the post office.
849.22|854.2|And two or three guys jumped him and took him into the post office
854.2|857.92|and tied him up and took his truck, a load of mail,
858.98|862.68|and went about nine miles to north of Halbrite out into a field
862.68|866.82|and opened up all the mail bags and searching -
867.14|870.48|I guess they got a bunch of money that was to go up to the co-op
871.06|872.94|or credit union in Estevan.
874.02|877.96|And they smashed the headlights on the truck, I don't know why,
878.2|880.92|and let it stand out in the field.
881.34|885.22|Somebody saw it, I guess, went out there and see what was happening
885.22|886.8|and found out it was the mail truck.
887.92|892.26|They have no clue whatever excepting from the driver who said,
892.26|896.86|that he thought there were three guys that jumped in and blindfolded him
896.86|900.28|and tied him up and put a rope around his neck to start with him.
902.32|905.9|He could be implicated in the thing too, you never know.
909.12|910.72|Anyway, that's the way it goes.
913.64|917.58|The snow is all gone here excepting on the north side of the building
917.58|918.44|there's a little.
918.72|920.6|The backyard might be two inches.
921.18|923.72|All the streets are icy, the sidewalks are icy.
923.92|924.74|Didn't all melt.
925.6|928.34|Didn't totally disappear, sort of melted a little during the day.
929.68|932.0|The sun don't get very high these days.
932.16|934.98|My God, I just said to Phyllis the other day,
935.1|939.22|I said it's going to have to keep working pretty hard to stay above the horizon
939.22|943.22|by the 21st of December the way we get up in the morning at 9 o'clock.
943.36|946.6|It's just barely showing up at 9 o'clock in the morning.
948.3|951.08|I don't know how it is with you fellas you're farther south.
953.62|955.26|Yeah, you'd see quite a bit
955.26|960.93|more of it than they do here, the days would be longer.
962.63|963.95|...
965.8|967.38|Oh! I got my reading machine.
967.9|972.38|Boy, I can really read the fine print with it.
972.74|977.66|When I was installing those parts on the water softer,
978.4|980.54|the print is so fine, you know.
980.6|982.58|And I'd put them there, and I could pull it up,
982.6|984.32|and I could read just as plain as anything.
985.04|987.72|So I opened my mail today, and the mail came in.
987.72|991.22|When I opened my letters, I was able to read the letters
991.22|992.44|and see what was in them.
993.84|997.12|So I'll have that to keep me busy.
997.22|1000.04|I won't be spending so much time on the tape.
1000.8|1003.6|During the day, I don't pay any attention to TV,
1003.78|1006.1|excepting I get an hour of news at noon.
1007.34|1011.64|And then I don't bother with TV until half past five.
1012.26|1017.46|I turn it on for the news from Yorkton.
1018.52|1022.24|And at six o'clock, the Regina news comes on.
1022.36|1023.82|So I watch it about an hour then.
1023.94|1026.5|And then I watch all these sports.
1028.62|1029.1|Football.
1030.68|1032.44|I'm still enjoying my football.
1033.02|1036.34|It's much better on TV than it was at the game.
1036.56|1038.04|Because you see all the replays.
1040.59|1042.23|I'm just going to stop for a minute.
1043.07|1045.63|I had to stop and clear my throat.
1046.09|1048.95|When I talk very much, my voice gets foggy.
1048.95|1050.95|Because I don't talk that much.
1051.13|1053.01|Around here, Phyllis and I are alone.
1053.15|1054.31|You don't get much talking.
1056.03|1058.05|So when you get a chance to talk,
1058.15|1059.89|for 10, 15 minutes straight,
1059.95|1062.43|your voice starts to go foggy right away.
1062.55|1062.99|I noticed that
1063.03|1064.57|yesterday, when I was up at Hugo's,
1065.53|1067.61|sat there for half an hour talking,
1067.97|1069.89|and my voice almost totally
1071.85|1073.61|faltered by the time I left there.
1075.43|1078.47|And I think it's just from a lack of exercise.
1081.0|1083.44|I'll have to do some taping to myself
1083.44|1085.36|and play them back and erase them
1085.36|1086.54|and tape them over again.
1087.02|1089.64|Oh yeah, I'm sending these tapes to you.
1089.72|1093.66|That's a second version of my life's history.
1096.1|1098.46|I wasn't happy with the first one.
1098.52|1099.5|It was badly taped.
1100.4|1102.04|Anyway, Jane and Joe,
1102.16|1104.14|they've got the first version of it.
1104.22|1106.22|And then I took and I run that over
1106.22|1109.48|and re-edited the whole thing.
1109.48|1111.64|And that's what you're getting now.
1112.74|1115.54|And when Danny gets a tape deck
1116.38|1117.62|I'll send him one.
1117.68|1119.22|I'll send him a copy, too.
1119.32|1120.98|In the meantime, he can listen to yours.
1121.1|1122.6|That's four hours of tape.
1123.7|1124.32|And,
1125.76|1127.12|you'll find some of it interesting,
1127.14|1129.32|some of it sort of monotonous.
1129.54|1130.42|Verlyn gave me
1130.6|1131.48|the dickens. She said, "
1131.66|1133.78|"You talked for four hours and
1133.9|1136.26|you never mentioned one thing about your family."
1136.76|1139.46|I said, "This was my life that I was talking about."
1139.48|1141.16|My working life.
1141.38|1142.3|Not that I,
1142.34|1146.42|not my family or the social side of my life.
1146.5|1149.26|It's my working life that I was taping,
1149.66|1152.12|and I'm sure that you and Dan
1152.12|1153.58|will get quite a bit out of it,
1153.62|1157.4|having both worked for the company
1157.4|1159.82|and has some notion of what it's all about,
1159.94|1161.58|what goes on out there.
1163.72|1166.0|And yeah, what else?
1168.71|1170.81|Oh yeah, at Ellen's funeral,
1171.07|1173.09|Lyle and family were down there.
1173.59|1174.07|And,
1175.97|1177.11|Lyle's still pretty,
1177.13|1180.57|pretty hefty feeling alright,
1180.57|1181.53|still working.
1182.95|1185.25|I know at one time that he was going to take a
1185.77|1186.61|last -
1189.05|1190.01|early retirement,
1190.25|1191.77|but I guess he's still
1191.77|1193.45|able to carry on.
1196.4|1197.42|I don't know
1198.76|1200.22|what's going to happen to dome.
1200.52|1201.84|They're still hanging on,
1202.72|1204.08|pushing the cart to heaven.
1205.72|1206.78|Or dragging it behind them,
1206.78|1207.14|whichever.
1208.64|1209.64|Every once in a while,
1209.7|1210.86|you hear something ...
1211.34|1212.22|They're in trouble,
1212.26|1213.46|they need refinancing
1214.42|1215.46|constanly, or financing ...
1215.9|1218.44|But just as long as they 
1218.56|1220.2|keep throwing his stuff down there.
1222.96|1224.3|And I haven't heard from Milton.
1224.38|1226.08|I wrote him a long letter about,
1227.44|1229.88|oh, about the end of August.
1231.24|1232.52|And he's still out in
1234.82|1236.1|Langley, B.C.
1236.2|1236.78|That's the way it is.
1241.36|1242.38|Had a letter from
1242.38|1244.1|Ken and Peggy Williams.
1244.1|1245.48|They're heading south
1246.16|1247.28|for Palm Springs
1247.28|1248.34|for four months.
1248.86|1249.6|So Norm,
1249.76|1250.88|if you want to find out something
1250.88|1252.06|about Palm Springs,
1253.04|1255.86|you can give them a call someday.
1256.94|1258.26|All they do is golf.
1258.58|1261.06|They get a place right by the golf course,
1261.12|1263.9|and I guess they've got a golf -
1266.66|1268.02|what you call it -
1269.76|1271.82|membership for the four months they're there,
1271.92|1273.02|and they're out on the golf course
1273.02|1273.52|every day.
1274.78|1276.02|I guess they're tired; in B.C.
1276.16|1277.94|they can golf all winter,
1278.02|1278.92|but it's just pretty wet.
1279.64|1281.72|And they have to put on rubber boots.
1282.04|1284.32|But they - the ardent golfers,
1284.38|1286.16|they'll go out and bat that ball around
1286.16|1287.04|even if it is wet.
1287.34|1292.95|On December the 9th,
1292.95|1293.83|just got a letter today
1293.83|1296.07|Central Line Contractors.
1297.77|1300.79|That's the one that I helped organize.
1301.07|1302.89|I was the first president
1302.89|1304.57|of the Central Line Contractors.
1304.57|1305.27|of Saskatchewan.
1306.07|1307.05|They're having a,
1308.78|1311.52|hospitality hour
1311.52|1313.44|in the Hotel Saskatchewan
1313.44|1314.42|on December the 9th,
1314.52|1317.08|so that'll be an evening out for me.
1318.54|1321.42|Get to see and hear what's going on
1321.42|1324.66|in the power business.
1324.86|1326.04|I don't hear much.
1326.14|1327.24|It's all very quiet.
1327.56|1329.28|Oh, Bud Waltz dropped in yesterday.
1329.4|1330.52|He's working in this area,
1330.54|1332.12|and he dropped in for a cup of coffee.
1333.68|1335.48|He's 57 years old.
1335.54|1337.12|He said, "I can't wait till I'm 60.
1337.28|1338.16|I want to get out."
1338.3|1340.52|He said, retire at 60.
1342.87|1344.83|It's getting tougher every day.
1344.93|1345.65|The older you get,
1346.29|1347.85|he's in the gas department now.
1347.91|1349.01|To get down on your knees
1349.01|1351.25|and work on these gas furnaces
1351.25|1352.19|isn't any joke.
1353.13|1354.09|I,
1354.19|1356.07|I've seen them come into my place here,
1356.19|1357.99|and if a guy's -
1358.19|1359.99|you know, you're in crowded quarters
1359.99|1361.69|and you have to get down on your knees.
1363.89|1364.99|It's hard work.
1371.3|1372.16|Bud would say,
1372.28|1373.66|"I haven't been off the shop.
1373.72|1375.34|I told you that ... Lumber
1375.34|1376.8|burnt down.
1376.8|1378.68|Just the office portion
1378.68|1379.42|of it burnt up,
1379.42|1381.58|and they knocked all the rest of it down.
1381.64|1382.66|There was nothing but a bare
1382.66|1383.34|lot there now."
1386.85|1388.41|Oh, we had some sad news
1388.41|1390.23|the day before yesterday.
1390.89|1391.65|Just that,
1392.97|1394.33|Clarence Herd,
1394.47|1395.51|and his wife, Agnes,
1395.55|1396.43|died suddenly.
1396.53|1398.15|This was in the obituaries.
1398.69|1402.27|Died suddenly on November the 20th,
1402.27|1405.31|And, private funeral.
1405.85|1407.29|He has three daughters,
1407.29|1408.49|one in Hawaii,
1408.83|1411.59|one in White Rock, B.C.,
1411.59|1412.33|and one in Winnipeg,
1412.81|1415.25|and a private funeral,
1415.43|1416.45|and then it comes out
1416.45|1418.29|that his wife had Alzheimer's,
1421.23|1422.03|and Alzheimer's,
1422.03|1425.63|and arthritis very badly,
1425.73|1428.89|and he carried her out to the garage.
1429.11|1430.39|Now, this is a story we get,
1430.47|1431.43|but it's true or not.
1431.85|1433.01|Carried her out to the garage,
1433.03|1434.35|and put her in the backseat of the car,
1434.37|1435.35|and he got in the front seat
1435.35|1436.53|and started the motor up,
1437.03|1438.49|and that was it.
1439.43|1441.01|I don't know how long it would take
1441.01|1443.93|you to get gassed out in the garage.
1444.73|1446.59|He would only have a single garage.
1447.65|1449.19|Probably wouldn't take very long.
1452.61|1454.25|So Clarence put an end to it.
1454.33|1458.77|He was about 74 or 5 years old,
1459.93|1461.33|and you know who he was,
1461.35|1463.05|he was on the ... Lumber
1463.05|1464.25|across the corner from me.
1464.37|1466.71|I had known him for 20 years.
1467.51|1469.13|But I was in business there,
1469.25|1472.59|And, of course, another 20 since that so I've known him for about a 40 years.
1473.99|1475.93|Real nice type of a guy.
1476.07|1478.33|Couldn't find a nicer man.
1479.33|1480.11|Good living.
1480.91|1484.43|And I guess the reason he went with her, they were a very close couple.
1485.79|1486.63|...
1487.47|1490.21|Throughout the years, he was quite a home man.
1490.47|1493.71|And I guess you couldn't take it anymore.
1497.85|1500.45|And Gordon South died.
1501.7|1504.02|I think Danny will have that in a letter...
1505.76|1507.6|He can't sell much of it.
1507.94|1517.12|Well, I guess he can if he's got a quota of 2.9 bushels per acre.
1517.38|1519.9|And that's for every cultivated acre you have.
1520.08|1522.86|So he could sell maybe most of his wheat.
1522.92|1526.78|The amount of acres he has cultivated between him and his boys.
1526.94|1528.84|They work in one big operation.
1533.49|1535.79|And he said he took him.
1535.83|1540.39|Last year, he took him $4,500 of oil.
1540.53|1542.03|And he doesn't own an oil well.
1542.71|1543.67|$45,000.
1544.71|1547.99|That was in surface rights.
1548.11|1550.71|They pay you $4,500 a well now.
1551.27|1557.53|And when they drill a well, I think they give you $5,000 or $6,000 for the initial year.
1558.65|1561.09|And then he had two or three dugouts.
1561.09|1562.13|And he's selling water.
1562.91|1564.79|Sells $1,000 worth of water
1565.23|1566.39|to Drill a well.
1567.75|1570.91|So he said that took him $45,000 of oil.
1571.91|1573.49|And don't own an oil well.
1575.43|1577.45|Just from the surface rights alone.
1578.75|1580.07|So that helped him.
1580.95|1585.61|But he's had a tough, tough, tough time.
1585.73|1586.59|Of expanding,
1587.89|1589.29|and a big family.
1589.63|1593.35|Want to keep the boys on the farm.
1593.47|1595.51|He had a family of 13, you know.
1595.83|1596.63|Same as we had.
1596.71|1598.01|And they lived on that same farm.
1600.75|1602.73|And they're all pretty well grown up.
1603.07|1606.23|The youngest one, maybe 12, 13 years old.
1609.4|1612.54|And when I was that age, I was doing a man's work around the farm.
1612.72|1614.72|Everything from driving an outfit
1614.88|1618.66|in the field to ...
1619.54|1621.4|you know, hauling manure.
1625.54|1626.44|Feeding the cows.
1626.74|1627.68|Milking the cows.
1627.76|1628.46|Feeding the lot.
1628.46|1630.16|You work
1630.32|1632.58|10, 12 hours a day ...
1633.08|1634.28|Unless you're at school.
1634.6|1640|Got away from some of it, then.
1640|1646.09|I think I told Danny about hunting.
1646.31|1649.45|I haven't heard a word about hunting for two years now.
1650.83|1658.52|Except Kevin Murphy, I know, goes out for a deer every year.
1659.1|1660.5|But I never see him.
1660.5|1662.16|I hear this from a friend of his.
1662.62|1664.22|And I'd see up to the Elks Club.
1664.34|1666.54|That they're going out
1666.78|1668.82|around Eastend for mule deer.
1670.4|1672.78|And this fella goes with Kevin.
1675.22|1680.26|And the old Murphy, oldest Murphy girl, had her second baby just the other day.
1681.1|1683.9|They've got two babies, in about one year.
1684.36|1687.95|I think Phyllis said
1687.95|1689.83|12, 13 months or something.
1693.93|1700.45|And the other one, Patsy, she was working as a nurse.
1700.55|1703.19|She had a sick spell a while back.
1703.19|1704.47|She wasn't going to work.
1705.07|1706.57|But I'd see her car is away now
1706.89|1708.25|so I guess she's back to work.
1712.31|1713.01|Nothing else
1713.07|1714.03|changed in the neighbourhood.
1714.13|1721.16|I never see the Sernics.
1721.2|1726.02|I saw Kenny and Mr. Sernic about six weeks ago.
1726.12|1727.34|I was out for a walk.
1728.04|1729.42|I went down Sunset.
1729.5|1731.76|And Kenny was out doing something to his car.
1731.96|1733.98|And I went over and talked to him.
1734.0|1735.8|I talked to him quite a while before.
1736.06|1737.22|I thought it was Wayne.
1737.32|1739.04|I had talked to him quite a while before.
1739.62|1740.46|I said, "You're Kenny."
1740.68|1741.44|And he said, yeah.
1741.6|1744.42|And he said, "I didn't think you recognized me."
1745.08|1746.7|I had poor eyesight again.
1754.3|1759.42|Mr. Sernic happened to come out to ask Kenny something while I was there.
1759.98|1761.46|I had a few words with him.
1761.62|1770.4|The Brown boys - haven't heard a thing for over a year now,
1770.54|1772.16|maybe a year and a half.
1772.36|1775.1|But Damien dropped it here one day.
1775.3|1778.18|And I wasn't home.
1778.24|1779.3|And he visited with Phyllis for a while.
1781.16|1785.04|But I understand he's the head Maître d' at ...
1785.42|1787.9|Unless he's changed in the last couple of months.
1788.22|1794.35|So that's sort of climbing up the ladder in a hurry.
1795.99|1802.09|I can't see in him as being the Maître d' at even a.
1802.61|1804.45|second rate Chinese Restaurant.
1806.57|1808.87|Well, I guess if I saw the way with people,
1809.07|1810.99|... up the ladder.
1818.18|1832.48|I'm not talking very fast, now. I might as well keep this thing going because you have to run it to the end anyway to get back to Tape 1.
1834.63|1840.5|So I can't think of anything else to say. Lots to say.
1843.82|1855.3|Uh, yeah, what else? The girls - Lynda called the other night wanting to know how to make dough for apple pie. A crust.
1856.3|1863.28|She was having problems couldn't get it to stick together. I couldn't believe it. At her age, she didn't know how to make a pie crust.
1868.33|1873.79|Phyllis told her and she did all the motions, but it was over a telephone so.
1873.93|1879.33|I don't know if Lynda got how you had to work it and everything.
1880.99|1884.61|... we didn't hear any more about that.
1892.3|1898.36|Pension cheque's come in; I've got to go down, put them in the bank to pay my bills.
1901.85|1909.58|They always come in four or five days before the end of the month. Thank goodness.
1920.3|1922.82|Phyllis was upstairs getting ready an hour ago.
1923.32|1926.56|What the time is it? It's going on to two o'clock, yeah.
1927.74|1930.8|Going on to two o'clock and shortly we'll be pulling out.
1938.74|1944.06|I don't know. I've been feeling good.
1944.26|1946.6|I walked, yesterday I walked 15 blocks.
1947.52|1951.92|Yesterday morning when I left for, walked down to Canadian Tire.
1953.46|1960.76|Well, first I walked, yeah, I walked for the bus to go for coffee.
1961.82|1966.66|By the time I get in for coffee, I walk up to the Optimist Club. That's four blocks.
1967.18|1968.32|Then catch the bus.
1969.14|1972.16|And then by the time I get in for coffee, that's six blocks.
1972.16|1976.06|Then I caught another bus and went down to Canadian Tire.
1976.24|1978.72|And then I went up to see Hugo and Tilly, had coffee there.
1979.0|1981.7|And I hope I figured out I had walked 15 blocks.
1982.82|1984.36|And it didn't bother me a bit.
1984.44|1986.68|But today I walked just about the same.
1986.78|1989.78|I walked down to Canadian Tire and back again.
1990.84|1992.92|That amounts to about 14 blocks.
1994.58|1997.42|My legs are standing up good.
1997.98|2000.8|In fact, I get some muscles that are hardening up,
2000.8|2002.9|they're always so flabby.
2003.86|2004.68|Now they're starting
2005.12|2005.88|to get some muscle.
2006.38|2007.74|I'm keeping my weight up.
2007.8|2009.62|I'm probably up a couple of pounds right now,
2009.76|2011.48|the way my pants fit.
2011.56|2015.54|I can't see the scales, so they're not ... me
2015.58|2016.56|going in and looking at it.
2018.66|2021.2|Unless I call Phyllis in to tell me how much I weigh
2021.32|2023.74|and I think she'd probably not tell me the truth
2023.84|2025.84|because she always tells me I should put on more weight.
2025.92|2027.02|And I said, "Yeah, then I'd have to
2027.02|2028.06|go out and buy new clothes.
2028.78|2031.32|Or else get them readjusted around the race band."
2032.44|2034.0|So I said, "I'm heavy enough."
2035.48|2037.38|When Bud Waltz saw me yesterday.
2037.52|2040.98|He was here when I came in from coffee.
2041.52|2043.58|And he looked happy.
2043.62|2049.66|He said, "Boy, you could put on - take some of Phyllis's excess weight around you;
2049.76|2050.6|and you'd look better
2050.74|2051.54|and she could look better."
2051.88|2053.68|I don't know how Phyllis liked it,
2053.94|2056.42|she I didn't say anything.
2057.28|2060.4|...
2060.4|2062.7|...
2065.96|2067.44|If I put on any weight
2067.54|2068.28|...
2068.34|2068.7|...
2071.27|2077.57|... it's time to slack up at the breakfast table and at the supper table ...
2081.18|2082.4|We're all set now
2082.56|2084.72|for Grey Cup on Sunday.
2085.64|2088.82|I'm afraid Hamilton will have trouble with Edmonton.
2089.36|2095.04|... pretty solid ... quarterback.
2095.12|2096.3|...
2097.3|2101.3|He copied from Moon, running with the ball.
2101.68|2104.06|They asked Parker the last game.
2104.98|2108.46|Don't you worry about him when he runs like that?
2108.54|2109.34|He said, that's the way
2109.34|2110.0|he wants to play it,
2110.18|2111.16|that's the only way he can get ...
2112.18|2113.98|so I let him go.
2114.7|2116.16|So far, so good.
2117.4|2120.24|But Hamilton played one hell of a game against Toronto
2121.03|2128.98|last Sunday. But the most impossible thing happened. I was up there the other night in Miami. It
2130.4|2135.26|wiping the jets out. Three points to, what, forty-five?
2135.84|2147.56|... kept on going, marking them up and marking them up.
2153.36|2155.56|Well, I'm about halfway through this tape I'm running,
2155.62|2157.68|put it on fast-forward and run it to the end,
2158.8|2159.44|throw it in the box and put it in the mail.
2161.46|2166.02|When you play this tape, when you play the big tape over,
2167.64|2169.54|when you run it, you have Danny there,
2169.54|2172.54|and I'm sure with the two of you, you'll get more out of it,
2172.7|2180.95|and you'll be able to add some comments about this and about that.
2182.89|2188.91|I often lay back and think now that some of the things that happened
2188.91|2197.89|in the course of my lifetime, it's hard to explain to somebody
2197.89|2200.33|that hasn't been there and done the same thing.
2200.57|2200.73|And...
2201.57|2205.33|My thrashing days, that don't mean anything to you fellas.
2205.77|2206.97|Well, that was the thing.
2207.03|2210.11|The harvest time, you know, that's when everything happened.
2212.29|2214.33|It was really something
2214.77|2220.03|for a young fellow like me to go to Raleigh about 19 years ago, started one-hand
2220.03|2220.81|thrashing machinery.
2222.03|2227.33|And it was always the stories that go around that this guy never, his machine never stops, or
2227.41|2229.15|that guy he's stopping half the time.
2229.79|2232.67|So if you were a good operator, everybody in the country knew you.
2232.99|2234.85|There's no question about that.
2235.73|2241.51|And as I've said right now, we've all been taught before that I always separate the grain
2241.51|2241.93|clean.
2242.15|2246.23|When they start cuffing in the elevators, the elevator man couldn't believe that
2246.23|2248.69|grain would come that clean out of the thresher.
2250.45|2251.91|To me,
2252.01|2254.85|it was just the only way you do it ...
2256.63|2257.83|Other than that,
2258.19|2260.57|you keep working at it until you get
2260.57|2261.73|everything set so that
2261.79|2262.63|it came out good.
2267.06|2267.94|... you can't
2268.3|2269.16|have a note -
2269.6|2277.66|notebook with you - taking notes about this and about that.
2277.98|2279.46|I can give you the details.
2280.24|2283.16|Verlyn said, how can you remember back 50 years?
2284.04|2285.52|Or 60, 70 years?
2285.76|2286.9|I said, "I don't know."
2287.64|2291.76|I can remember in detail things that happened 40, 50 years ago.
2292.58|2294.36|And remember the dates and everything.
2294.46|2294.94|No problem.
2297.02|2297.56|Ask me what I had for breakfast
2297.58|2300.98|or supper last night and I have to think like hell.
2302.6|2305.16|To remember what I ate for supper last night.
2305.3|2307.68|That was part of growing old.
2310.04|2310.7|Oh, yeah.
2310.76|2313.8|I had a letter from Cascade, Iowa from the cousins that were up here this summer.
2314.46|2319.48|And they mentioned about Uncle Hiller that was my mother's youngest brother who is still
2319.48|2321.42|living at 104 years of age.
2321.62|2324.34|He fell last spring and cracked his hip.
2324.42|2326.78|But he's back up walking again.
2328.14|2331.68|His mind, I guess, is sort of straying a bit.
2331.74|2336.9|She said - I had put a message in the letter to her for her dad 
2337.3|2339.02|and she read it out to him -
2339.34|2343.56|She said he couldn't remember much about the Achens excepting Lorry.
2343.76|2344.76|Well, that's the oldest brother.
2345.02|2347.32|He and Lorry were just about the same age.
2348.46|2351.1|So his memory must be failing a bit,
2351.12|2352.12|which one can I expect
2352.46|2353.72|at that age.
2355.22|2356.2|Remark ...
2356.2|2361.1|He was never a strong man. He was always a kind of a frail looking fellow.
2361.26|2365.4|I remember, back of 1925 when I first met him,
2366.08|2368.48|he had a crippled arm -
2368.82|2369.8|one-hooked arm.
2370.22|2371.86|The elbow was stiffened.
2373.8|2375.02|He used that one.
2375.08|2375.66|He could tip -
2375.68|2376.56|he was a good drinker -
2376.58|2377.36|He could tip a drink with it alright.
2377.6|2383.74|But on the other hand ... he was a frail looking man, man.
2383.74|2385.3|He was a man never weighed over
2385.3|2388.82|140, 145 pounds.
2389.79|2391.57|And all the rest of the Smiths
2389.8|2393.12|were big huge fellows.
2393.76|2395.72|Up to 250 pounds.
2398.91|2400.47|So I wish you well.
2400.75|2403.57|Including you, Linda, and all the kids.
2403.99|2407.77|A very, very, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
2411.03|2412.45|Well, I should be talking to you
2412.59|2413.19|at that time.
2415.17|2416.33|So as they say,
2416.75|2417.95|Over and out.
2417.95|2436.45|Just now I was wondering what all that noise was.
2436.53|2438.95|And I find out I had the microphone in my hand.
2438.95|2440.45|And there's the cord bent
2440.57|2442.97|a little bit that does all that clicking and whatnot.
2444.11|2448.33|So I'll know better the next time I set the mic down and talk into it.
