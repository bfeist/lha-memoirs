6.45|10.61|I go right back, and it starts in where I taped ...
25.24|28.24|I'll roll this back now and see what's happening.
31.51|37.57|Yes, it was erasing and taping over, so I'll just keep on talking now
37.57|48.57|and go back and start relating the story from where I was born at Remsen, Iowa, October the 7th, 1902.
48.57|55.36|My folks were living on the farm, as far as I know.
55.36|57.36|They were farming at that time.
57.36|67.36|My dad had been a drayman and a policeman in a town of 1,200 with 11 barrooms in it.
67.36|69.36|Those were the hectic days,
69.36|72.36|the pioneer days for western Iowa.
72.36|74.36|However, he farmed for some years.
74.36|81.36|He had three or four teenage boys at that time, so he thought it best to get out on the farm.
81.36|85.36|And for some reason or other, some land agent got a hold of him
85.36|91.36|and suggested that with a gang of boys like he had, he should be up in Canada
91.36|96.36|where land was cheap and a lot of room for expansion.
96.36|99.36|At that particular time, land in Iowa was selling,
99.36|107.36|well, roughly $80 an acre, where you could buy it up in Canada from $20 to $25 an acre.
107.36|109.36|But it was still the raw prairie.
109.36|114.36|It had to be broke up and put into cultivation before you could get anything off it.
114.36|123.36|And I guess they did a good job selling because dad had a lot of courage to move up in that godforsaken country
123.36|128.36|when he was in a good corn growing,
128.36|132.36|well-established community down there.
132.36|142.36|Well, we went up to Canada and they had about three boxcars of, I guess, mostly animals and some machinery.
142.36|145.36|They didn't have much machinery that you could use up in Canada.
145.36|152.36|But along with what they took along, they had a boxcar load of it.
152.36|156.36|And the rest was packed up in the passenger train and headed out.
156.36|163.36|I don't know the history of whether we—I'm sure we didn't have sleepers.
163.36|168.36|And we would have had to stop possibly overnight in Minneapolis when we got there.
168.36|170.36|I don't remember any of that.
170.36|174.36|I do faintly remember some of the train ride.
174.36|179.36|And there were—the two boys went with the boxcars of animals.
179.36|185.36|And they tell of all the fun they had riding in those side door pullmans,
185.36|188.36|if they call them, along with the animals,
188.36|194.36|all the way up from Remsen, Iowa, up to Sioux Falls, Sioux City,
194.36|199.36|and then up what they call the Sioux Line, up to Halbrite.
199.36|204.36|And landed there on the 17th of March,
204.36|209.36|after a winter of the greatest snowfall the prairie had ever seen.
209.36|214.36|There was an estimated 36 inches of snow in Malapa that winter.
214.36|217.36|However, we landed at Halbrite.
217.36|221.36|And now this is where my memory starts to get in gear.
221.36|223.36|We stayed in the hotel.
223.36|228.36|And I have a faint recollection of us being in this hotel.
228.36|231.36|This is Mother and all the children.
231.36|237.36|And then the boys and Dad arrived up there.
237.36|239.36|Well, I guess Dad was on the train with us.
239.36|243.36|And the boys came up with the livestock, and they had to unload.
243.36|246.36|And take it out to the farm.
246.36|248.36|Now, when they got out there, everything was under snow.
248.36|253.36|They tell that they had to dig into a snowbank to find the barn, a stable.
253.36|258.36|And I'd like to see, you know they - just what went on.
258.36|262.36|These guys coming from Iowa were, if they had six inches of snow there,
262.36|263.36|it was a big snowfall.
263.36|268.36|And here they come out with three foot of snow on the level.
268.36|272.36|We landed in a farm.
272.36|275.36|Six miles north of Halbrite.
275.36|281.6|As I remember it, the house stood there for years and years after.
281.6|287.91|It was a two-bedroom house with a dining room, kitchen combined.
287.91|291.91|Or a dining room, living room combined, and quite a large kitchen.
291.91|299.91|And that house stood there for 20, 30 years after we lived in it for the first summer.
299.91|303.91|And I don't have any recollection of the sleeping arrangements,
303.91|305.91|where we all slept or anything.
305.91|310.29|But there were 12 of us.
310.29|313.29|But the youngest one wasn't born yet.
313.29|318.29|But there were 12 of us and mother and dad lived in that house.
318.29|323.29|And I can't figure out, we must have had solid mattresses on the floors
323.29|328.91|in order to find a place to sleep.
328.91|333.91|But first I remember the snow was all gone when I remembered that.
333.91|337.91|I can remember the ride out there with all the deep snow.
337.91|338.91|All you could see was snow.
338.91|341.91|As far as the eye could see, everything was white.
341.91|348.76|And then everything blanks out to me.
348.76|355.76|The next thing I can remember is that I would have been four and a half years old at that time.
355.76|363.76|And Liona was just past three, about 14 months younger than I was.
363.76|369.76|And the two of us walked across the mile where they were building the house on our regular farm
369.76|370.76|where we were going to live.
371.76|376.76|And I can remember just a faint recollection.
376.76|378.76|I guess we sneaked away without authority or anything.
378.76|381.76|We followed the trail, just a trail over there.
381.76|383.76|We followed the trail over there.
383.76|386.76|And the people in the house, they gave us cookies.
386.76|395.76|And I remember prunes. And Liona ate so many prunes that she had that nickname for years after Prunes Achen.
395.76|403.35|And then I have no recollection of us moving into that new house.
403.35|405.35|And that's funny.
405.35|411.35|And I don't remember, we moved over there that fall before winter set in.
411.35|412.35|That house was finished.
412.35|418.35|They put on, the original house was 14 feet by 20 feet with just a bedroom.
418.35|423.35|The whole upstairs was a bedroom and had a sort of a ladder to get upstairs.
423.35|431.35|Well, then they put on an extension with three bedrooms on it and a big dining room and a big living room
431.35|433.35|and a new stairway going up.
433.35|438.35|So we are well off because we had one of the bigger houses in the community.
438.35|443.79|And now we're talking into 1905.
443.79|446.79|I don't think I started school.
446.79|453.79|I must have been eight or nine years old when I started school.
453.79|457.79|We used to, we had two schools.
457.79|464.97|We started at Crow Lake School and that was two miles across the field.
464.97|465.97|But we had to go around the road.
465.97|467.97|And it was three miles to Crow Lake.
467.97|472.97|I can remember starting school there with the Orsted boys in ...
472.97|475.97|And Joe Barlow, Manning Body.
475.97|477.97|We were all in grade one.
477.97|480.97|And we were learning to - the ABCs.
480.97|485.97|And I think we went there maybe two years.
485.97|488.97|And for some reason that school was closed down.
488.97|490.97|And then we went to DeVille School.
490.97|492.97|That was in the other direction.
492.97|496.25|Two miles again across
496.25|499.25|country, no roads.
499.25|504.25|We went there for, as I remember it, only one year.
504.25|508.25|And then Crow Lake School opened up again.
508.25|510.25|And we used to go around the road.
510.25|512.25|We drove horses the three miles.
512.25|514.25|And in the summer when they needed the horses in the field,
514.25|517.25|we walked the three miles.
517.25|520.25|And then at certain times of the year when it was dry enough,
520.25|523.25|we'd cut straight across the fields.
523.25|527.25|And that was just two miles going across that way.
527.25|530|And we used to go a walk, you know the
530|533.3|mosquitoes would be so bad that we'd run to get away from them.
533.35|537|You'd run for a ways and then you'd slow down.
537.1|539.25|And then when they'd congregate again around you,
539.25|541.31|you'd run for another stretch -
541.31|546.24|and that's the way you got your education,
546.24|549.02|on foot to school and back.
549.25|551.09|Went there.
551.09|555.72|And when I was about ten years or twelve years old - 
555.72|556.72|No, I wasn't twelve then,
556.72|558.72|maybe eleven.
558.72|560.72|And we were driving.
560.72|562.72|A single horse on a buggy.
562.72|565.72|And four or five of us would pile in that one-seated buggy.
565.72|569.72|Some would stand in the back, stand on the axle.
569.72|575.96|And an old great big horse that - that drove back and forth.
575.96|579.96|And then, as I said, in the summertime when they needed them in the fields,
579.96|580.96|well, we would walk.
580.96|584.59|Well, I kept up.
584.59|586.59|That was my education, going to school.
586.59|588.59|But I will say this much,
588.59|591.59|when you're in grade, by the time you're in grade four,
591.59|593.59|you knew the times table.
593.59|595.59|Not just the four times.
595.59|597.59|You knew them right up to twelve times.
597.59|599.59|You knew spelling.
599.59|601.59|You knew geography.
601.59|603.59|You've got a good grounding in education.
603.59|604.59|There's no...
604.59|605.59|And writing.
605.59|608.59|They're very particular about your writing.
608.59|609.59|How you learn to write.
609.59|614.59|Make the letters, letter perfect, so to speak.
614.59|617.59|And then I...
617.59|620.59|Remember when I was about ten years old,
620.59|624.59|mother and dad took a trip back to Iowa via train.
624.59|628.59|For some reason, I was picked to go back with them.
628.59|630.59|I don't know if I was cute or so mean
630.59|632.59|they couldn't leave me at home or what it was,
632.59|634.59|but I went to Iowa with them.
634.59|636.59|I remember quite a bit about that trip,
636.59|640.59|about being at the various uncles' places.
640.59|642.59|And there were cousins there my age,
642.59|645.59|and we used to have a lot of fun playing.
645.59|646.59|It was in the fall of the year.
646.59|649.59|And then dad and I came back.
649.59|651.59|And mother stayed.
651.59|653.59|For some reason, she stayed.
653.59|655.59|And dad and I came back,
655.59|657.59|and I still remember us being in Minneapolis.
657.59|659.59|And he went down to a bar room
659.59|663.13|and took me down with him.
663.13|666.13|And there were all kinds of food.
666.13|669.13|You could have all the food you wanted for free.
669.13|671.13|A glass of whiskey at that time,
671.13|674.13|I guess, was about 25 cents.
674.13|676.13|And then as we went home that night,
676.13|677.13|I remember we went
677.13|679.13|down the street,
679.13|680.13|and he said,
680.13|681.13|"Take a look down this window."
681.13|683.13|We looked down a basement window,
683.13|686.13|and here there were newspaper machines down there,
686.13|689.13|running all automated newspaper machines.
689.13|691.13|And the papers were coming out of there
691.13|695.13|just like nobody's business.
695.13|697.13|Then I remember going home from Minneapolis,
697.13|699.13|and dad had me singing.
699.13|701.13|I could sing pretty good.
701.13|703.13|Some of the old songs of the day.
703.13|705.13|And of course I'd sing,
705.13|707.13|and then everybody would hand me a dime - a dime!
707.13|709.13|I had dimes,
709.13|711.13|and I had porters on the train
711.13|715.79|that were selling candies, oranges, and apples,
715.79|718.79|and all sorts of good things.
718.79|720.79|No soft drinks in those days.
720.79|723.79|But I ate so much of this stuff I got sick,
723.79|725.79|and I started puking.
725.79|729.79|And that was the end of the singing.
729.79|733.79|This train ride to Minneapolis home was about,
733.79|735.79|oh, I would imagine,
735.79|737.79|about a 24-hour train ride
737.79|739.79|to Minneapolis, yes.
739.79|741.79|It would be, oh, 24 hours
741.79|745.62|to get from our place up to Minneapolis.
745.62|748.62|I don't remember anything else then until 19...
748.62|750.62|Oh, no, not any detail,
750.62|753.62|except milking cows and doing chores,
753.62|754.62|and you start doing that
754.62|757.62|when you're eight years old on the farm.
757.62|759.62|And at 11 years old,
759.62|761.62|I rigged up a team of horses on a hay rack,
761.62|765.62|and I was a straw monkey in the thrashing house.
765.62|766.62|At 12 years old,
766.62|768.62|I was out disking the land
768.62|770.62|with horses while the boys,
770.62|771.62|all the older ones,
771.62|773.62|were busy with the thrashing.
773.62|776.62|I couldn't remember that very well.
776.62|777.62|And you really had to work
777.62|779.62|when you were on the farm.
779.62|781.62|As soon as you were old enough
781.62|783.62|to pull weeds,
783.62|784.62|at five and six years old,
784.62|788.62|you're out pulling weeds in the garden.
788.62|796.6|And when I was ... 11,
796.6|798.6|that would have been 1913,
798.6|799.6|that's right,
799.6|803.6|then Sister Aloysia was already
803.6|806.6|a novice in the convent,
806.6|809.14|at 14.
809.14|811.14|And Sister Hilary and I
811.14|815.14|both went to the convent that winter.
815.14|817.14|Mary got an education, too.
817.14|818.14|I was 11 years old.
818.14|819.14|Well, I...
819.14|821.14|Yeah, 11 years old,
821.14|824.14|and I had to do my own laundry.
824.14|825.14|You were on Saturdays,
825.14|826.14|you did your own laundry,
826.14|828.14|you washed your clothes,
828.14|830.77|got a change of clothes,
830.77|832.77|took a bath once a week,
832.77|834.77|I don't remember what bathtubs are.
834.77|836.77|I think we just took a bath.
836.77|838.77|The boys had their own room
838.77|839.77|down in the washroom,
839.77|840.77|in the laundry room.
840.77|841.77|We'd take a bath
841.77|843.77|out of an ordinary wash tub.
843.77|849.26|The food was plain and simple
849.26|850.26|and you had to eat
850.26|852.26|what was put on your plate,
852.26|853.26|or have a darn good reason
853.26|854.26|why you didn't eat it.
854.26|855.26|...
855.26|857.26|because you didn't like it,
857.26|860.95|that you were sick or something
860.95|861.95|was the only reason
861.95|862.95|you got away from eating
862.95|864.95|the food that was put before you.
864.95|866.95|I remember I was in grade five,
866.95|872.5|and at Easter time,
872.5|874.5|we went home,
874.5|877.5|and I didn't go back.
877.5|879.5|I don't know why I didn't go back.
879.5|881.5|I don't remember if Sister Hilary
881.5|883.5|went back then or not.
883.5|885.5|But I started school at home,
885.5|887.5|and I wrote my grade five exam
887.5|888.5|at home.
888.5|893.2|Then I must have missed a year,
893.2|896.2|or I must have failed a grade,
896.2|899.2|because I went...
899.2|902.2|I passed my grade six,
902.2|903.2|I would have been about...
903.2|907.57|I must have been fourteen
907.57|911.9|or at least fourteen
911.9|913.9|or into my fifteenth year.
913.9|921.93|And then I started school
921.93|923.93|in grade seven.
923.93|924.93|Now, I would have been
924.93|926.93|about fifteen years old
926.93|928.93|that fall, I guess.
928.93|929.93|And the teacher and I
929.93|931.93|couldn't see eye to eye at all.
931.93|932.93|I guess I was as stubborn
932.93|934.93|as a fourteen or fifteen-year-old
934.93|936.93|can be.
936.93|938.93|And she and I were jangling
938.93|940.93|all the time as the saying
940.93|941.93|go:
941.93|942.93|I was lipping her back
942.93|943.93|and whatnot.
943.93|945.93|And I was dissatisfied then,
945.93|949.43|and I said to Mother one day,
949.43|950.43|I want to quit school.
950.43|951.43|What are you going to do?
951.43|953.43|I said, "I'll go trapping."
953.43|955.43|You could trap coyotes
955.43|956.43|and weasels
956.43|959.43|and what have you.
959.43|960.43|So she said,
960.43|962.43|"Well, if you don't like school,
962.43|963.43|well, you might as well quit."
963.43|964.43|And I quit school.
964.43|966.43|That was my education.
966.43|972.77|And many, many times
972.77|973.77|after I was grown up,
974.77|975.77|and away from home,
975.77|977.77|I wish I'd have had more education.
977.77|984|However, I got by, as it was.
984|984.72|I went on the trap line then.
984.72|986.72|Well, the trap line,
986.72|988.72|I was doing chores at home.
988.72|995.04|And, now Joe - I think Joe was in the Army at that time.
998|998.19|And now, Zip,
998.19|1000.19|I don't remember if he went.
1000.19|1002.19|Maybe he was going to school
1002.19|1003.19|in Weyburn.
1003.19|1004.19|He went back to school
1004.19|1006.19|after he had quit for a while.
1006.19|1008.19|He went to Weyburn
1008.19|1011.19|and got his high school
1011.19|1012.19|up,
1012.19|1014.19|he got,
1014.19|1016.19|I would think he got his grade
1016.19|1017.19|nine and ten.
1017.19|1020.43|During that time,
1020.43|1021.43|well, I was at home
1021.43|1022.43|and we had a lot of livestock.
1022.43|1023.43|There's always so much work
1023.43|1024.43|to do around there.
1024.43|1025.43|It would take you
1025.43|1026.43|all forenoon
1026.43|1028.43|to get the chores done up.
1028.43|1030.43|You had to clean the barns
1030.43|1031.43|every day at our place.
1031.43|1033.43|There was no other way around it.
1033.43|1036.43|Every animal had nice bedding,
1036.43|1039.74|nice straw place to lay down.
1039.74|1040.74|And then in the afternoon,
1040.74|1041.74|I'd go out and I'd set trap
1041.74|1043.74|and I'd try to catch the odd weasel,
1043.74|1044.74|a weasel skin is worth
1044.74|1045.74|maybe a dollar,
1045.74|1046.74|a dollar and a quarter.
1046.74|1047.74|And there were skunks around
1047.74|1048.74|and that skunk was worth
1048.74|1050.74|two and a half or three dollars.
1050.74|1052.74|And I caught the odd coyote
1052.74|1053.74|and they were worth
1053.74|1054.74|up to fifteen,
1054.74|1055.74|twenty dollars.
1055.74|1056.74|And so,
1056.74|1058.74|I was doing this trapping
1058.74|1059.74|on horseback.
1059.74|1061.74|I'd get on the old black mare,
1061.74|1062.74|old lady,
1062.74|1064.74|and I'd ride,
1064.74|1065.74|you know,
1065.74|1066.74|two or three miles away
1066.74|1067.74|from fifteen,
1067.74|1068.74|twenty blows zero.
1068.74|1069.74|You didn't stop for that.
1069.74|1071.74|Go and check your traps
1071.74|1072.74|if you caught something
1072.74|1073.74|and you brought them home
1073.74|1074.74|and you skinned them.
1074.74|1075.74|That was,
1075.74|1076.74|you kept busy all the time.
1076.74|1078.74|There was never a dull moment.
1078.74|1079.74|If you had any reading to do,
1079.74|1080.74|you did it at night
1080.74|1082.74|by coal or a lamp.
1082.74|1087.15|And reading wasn't as common
1087.15|1088.15|as it is today.
1088.15|1091.15|We had no radio at that time.
1091.15|1092.15|So you didn't get any news.
1092.15|1094.15|You were sort of blanked out,
1094.15|1095.15|as they say.
1095.15|1096.15|The news you got was
1096.15|1097.15|when Dad'd come home from town,
1097.15|1099.15|he'd go to town
1099.15|1100.15|two or three times a week
1100.15|1101.15|and he'd always bring home
1101.15|1102.15|all the gossip
1102.15|1103.15|from the neighborhood,
1103.15|1104.15|you know,
1104.15|1105.15|what he had heard.
1105.15|1107.15|But we had telephone installed
1107.15|1110.15|when I was about twelve,
1110.15|1112.15|eleven or twelve years old
1112.15|1114.15|when we had the telephone installed.
1114.15|1116.15|So you had some communication
1116.15|1117.15|with the neighbors,
1117.15|1119.15|which was good for the women
1119.15|1120.15|in particular.
1120.15|1121.15|The boys,
1121.15|1123.15|we never talked back and forth.
1123.15|1125.15|We had neighbor boys,
1125.15|1126.15|but we wanted to talk to them.
1126.15|1127.15|We got on a horse
1127.15|1128.15|and rode over there,
1129.27|1130.38|visited in that way.
1132|1133.69|And life was simple, very simple.
1133.69|1138.39|You worked hard and you ate well, and you slept well.
1138.39|1139.66|And the next day, you got up
1139.66|1141.69|and it was the same thing over and over.
1143|1144.38|And to get back to trapping,
1144.38|1146|after I was trapping for a while,
1146|1150|I found out there was a place in St. Louis, Missouri
1150|1152|where you'd ship your hides.
1152|1154.49|There was no one duty or anything to get them across the line.
1154.49|1162.04|And I found out that you got about half again as much for a coyote skin down there.
1162.04|1164.58|So I started shipping them down there -
1164.72|1166.72|and skunks the same.
1166.72|1167.72|And then I found out
1167.72|1168.72|that I'd go out
1168.72|1169.72|and I'd buy them
1169.72|1170.72|from the neighbors
1170.72|1171.72|with the,
1171.72|1172.72|they would price them
1172.72|1174.72|at what they could get
1174.72|1175.72|in the Canadian market
1175.72|1176.72|and then I'd ship
1176.72|1177.72|to the States
1177.72|1178.72|and make myself
1178.72|1179.72|a nice profit
1179.72|1180.72|maybe a lot of times
1180.72|1181.72|50% profit.
1181.72|1182.72|I know in one case
1182.72|1183.72|I went to a fellow's place,
1183.72|1184.72|he had wolfhounds
1184.72|1185.72|and he went over there
1185.72|1186.72|and he had
1186.72|1187.72|10 or 12 coyote skins.
1187.72|1188.72|They were in bad shape
1188.72|1191.76|they'd been tore up and they were bloody and everything.
1191.76|1193.72|And he wanted
1193.72|1194.72|$10 a piece for them
1194.72|1197.5|and I had another neighbor boy with me
1197.5|1198.72|and we went out of there, we had,
1198.72|1202|I think we had six or seven hides.
1202|1202.7|Some of them were so bad
1202.72|1203.82|I wouldn't buy them.
1203.82|1206|And they had averaged me $3 a piece.
1206|1206.72|When I showed them
1206.72|1207.72|a few greenbacks
1207.72|1208.72|well,
1208.72|1209.72|he started
1209.72|1210.72|coming around.
1211.72|1213.93|I took them down in the dark basement
1213.93|1216|with the cold oil lamp - lantern
1216|1219.1|and then I redressed those hides and I put them on a proper stretcher
1219.1|1219.72|and got them
1219.72|1222.2|the lead washed off them and cleaned up.
1222.2|1224.54|The first one I sent away I got
1224.54|1227.67|more for it than I'd paid for the whole lot.
1228.72|1229.72|And,
1229.72|1230.72|well,
1230.72|1231.72|that only lasted
1231.72|1232.72|so long
1232.72|1233.72|and then
1233.72|1234.72|this all
1234.72|1235.72|happened in about
1235.72|1236.72|one winter
1236.72|1237.72|that I was dealing
1237.72|1238.72|in furs
1238.72|1239.72|besides doing
1239.72|1240.72|the chores at home.
1240.72|1241.95|And that was over with.
1241.95|1245.65|Well, now I'm into 16 and 17 years old.
1245.69|1250.1|The war was on, and it was work, work, work.
1250.12|1251.92|Joe and Zip, Joe went in the Army.
1252.57|1253.67|Zip was away from home,
1253.69|1254.97|he was getting an education.
1255.05|1256.79|And I was the main one.
1256.81|1259.15|Mac was, what, two and a half years younger than me.
1259.79|1261.56|And we always had to do all the chores.
1261.58|1264.28|So you worked, worked, and worked.
1264.3|1271.35|You would work eight, ten hours a day, every day, in the wintertime as well as in the summer.
1271.37|1272.57|Summertime, you worked from
1272.82|1281.21|five in the morning until eight at night, every day, six days a week, and then do the chores on Sunday.
1281.25|1283.29|We always milked a half dozen cows.
1283.87|1286.71|Besides, it was all horse farming in those days.
1286.78|1291.74|They had up to 50, 60 horses around the farm that you had to look after.
1292.9|1299.39|In the summer when I was, what, 1915, I was 13 years old that fall.
1301.22|1302.79|Yeah, this is hard to believe.
1303.79|1306.31|And Joe and Zip were home that summer.
1307.91|1311.88|And the three of us hauled rock and gravel all summer.
1311.89|1314.12|Had three wagons and horses.
1314.14|1322.29|And we'd used to go 13 miles down to the river to get three loads of sand, load them up, and take them home.
1322.33|1326.05|By the time we got home, we'd leave at, say, 7 or 8 in the morning.
1326.07|1328.21|By the time we got home, it was 4 in the afternoon.
1328.89|1330.88|And you had to unload your load,
1331.19|1336.76|and then do the chores, and then be ready to make the trip the next day.
1337.66|1345.13|And this went on, I guess, for two months that we were hauling material to build this big barn.
1345.15|1346.17|It was a huge barn.
1346.19|1352.28|The foundation was 56 feet one way and 60 feet the other way.
1353.34|1356.44|And then the contractor came in and he built the barn.
1356.86|1385.2|he put down the foundation everything then we had to haul all those rock in to fill that foundation in and then filled it up with sand so they could put a four inch coat of cement all over the barn it was an up-to-date barn everything was first class. That's when I was 13 years old that fall, the fall of 1915. You want to know about work, well that was work and that same
1385.78|1390.61|The year before that, yeah, we didn't have a decent well on the farm.
1391.01|1394.94|My brother Mac and I, he would have been about ten, I guess.
1394.96|1398.66|We were hauling water with a team of horses and a big wooden tank.
1398.68|1414.19|We used to have to go two and a half miles up to where there was a pond and get this water and then haul it down and dump it in the big tank in the pasture where there were about, oh, there would have been three, four hundred
1414.72|1419.13|head of cattle in that 1,500-acre pasture.
1419.15|1428.14|And that went on until we finally got a well at home that wouldn't go dry, and then we didn't have to haul water anymore.
1428.52|1429.54|We didn't have to pump it.
1429.56|1432.07|They'd pump it into the tank and haul it down.
1432.11|1434.43|Somebody else finally took that job over.
1435.29|1439.74|We probably had to go to school when the school term started.
1439.76|1442.83|I don't remember the detail.
1442.83|1448.84|But that gives you an idea of how hard we worked when we were young.
1448.86|1454.69|I often said, I don't know what all the help -
1454.71|1457.84|I was the seventh son, and Mac was the eighth one.
1457.86|1470.95|And as soon as we were able to work, I can remember when they built that pasture in 1914, I guess it was, that they used to haul us a mile and a half away, and we'd dig post holes all day
1471.51|1474.45|with a postal order, and they'd come and pick us up at night.
1474.59|1483.87|We'd have our lunch with us out there, but the bald prairie, no trees or no shade or anything, just out there working.
1483.89|1492.4|And you'd get so tired that you'd stop and snare golfers once in a while, just for getting a little bit of a rest.
1494.77|1496.57|Well, that's
1496.87|1501.12|through the 1914, '15, '16, it was the same thing.
1501.16|1502.58|It was a repetitious thing.
1504.1|1506.97|And short on help.
1506.99|1509.11|I wasn't going to school then.
1509.95|1510.93|Work, work, work.
1512.14|1515.64|1917, bad, kind of a bad year.
1515.66|1519.62|1916, yeah.
1522.24|1529.41|Then, '17 is a short crop, '18 was a short crop.
1529.43|1534.8|Now by this time, I'm 15 years old, I'm taking a man's place hauling bundles.
1534.82|1541.75|And I've been out hauling bundles, and I'd be so tired when night came that I couldn't throw on the load anymore.
1541.77|1548.78|I'd just throw on a rack full and come in, and my brother would unload them at the machine.
1548.8|1553.2|And that went on, 1917.
1554.08|1579.61|1918 short crop. 1919 less crop again but we always fared somehow we had a lot of always raised 50 60 hogs for sale and we always had hens, 125 hens around so we had our own eggs our own pork had our own beef we always had 50 60 head of cattle and about that many horses so you're never short on work
1581.52|1583.78|As 1919, we dried out.
1583.8|1588.05|1920, the hoppers came in and just about cleaned us out.
1590.39|1592.95|In 1921, then, we got a crop.
1592.97|1598.84|And Dad bought a... Oh, in the meantime, 1918, he had bought a little Titan tractor.
1598.86|1601.89|It was about equivalent to four horses.
1601.91|1603.59|Or maybe, no, do more than that.
1603.63|1606.09|Do the work of about six horses.
1606.11|1607.07|But it was slow.
1607.09|1610.8|It would only travel about less than three miles an hour.
1611.84|1615.71|And in 1921, we had a crop.
1615.73|1616.65|Not a good crop.
1616.67|1620.93|It went about 20 bushels per acre, but a low grade of wheat.
1620.95|1625.08|Dad bought a small separator for that thrashing outfit.
1625.1|1632.15|And for some reason or other, while we were getting it rigged up, he and Joe - Joe and Zip were home that fall.
1634.51|1640.04|They got in a jangle of some kind, and I was 19 years old that fall.
1640.88|1642.55|And so he got mad at him.
1642.57|1646.27|He said, "Linden's going to run this outfit, and you guys can haul bundles."
1647.05|1652.38|So I was the chief cook and bottle washer around the thrashing machine.
1652.4|1656.23|I was running the thrashing outfit, and I run that same outfit then in 1921.
1657.07|1659.91|'22, we had a bumper crop.
1659.93|1661.68|'23, we had a bumper crop.
1662.82|1667.13|'24, the spring of '24, my dad died.
1668.66|1670.52|And that was a short crop that year.
1670.54|1677.33|We had only maybe 18, 15 or 18 bushels to the acre.
1677.35|1678.19|It was a short crop.
1678.77|1680.81|We were through harvesting real early.
1683.93|1692.38|And, oh yes, in '24, in '24, yeah, we had finished.
1692.4|1694.1|And then I went up to Griffin.
1694.12|1696.72|I got a job running a thrashing outfit up there.
1697.21|1699.37|I just, what was I, in '24?
1699.39|1700.62|I was 22 years old.
1702.44|1706.5|And after that, I went thrashing for another fellow.
1706.52|1716.01|Oh, I could tell you the incidental experiences that I had on those thrashing outfits when I got around and saw how those guys run a thrasher after I had run one enough.
1716.53|1721.92|I was always so sure when I started that machine in the morning that it wouldn't stop until night and nothing would happen.
1722.52|1724.55|It had eight or ten belts on it.
1724.57|1727.41|You had to have those all laced up properly and everything.
1728.33|1733.7|And you had to have everything set just right that they couldn't plug the machine by throwing in too much at one time.
1734.5|1735.98|And all that.
1736.04|1741.07|Unless you thrashed, it would be very difficult for you to understand what I'm talking about.
1742.11|1743.25|That was in 1924.
1743.77|1746.01|But I was managing the farm when Dad died.
1746.95|1748.26|Bud was old enough then.
1748.44|1752.26|Bud was, what, 13 years old at that time.
1753.47|1761.76|And so between, he was going to school, but when he wasn't to school, he was helping, you know, taking a man's place.
1763.69|1766.37|He went to school and got his grade eight education.
1767.03|1771.22|Mac dropped out of school about grade seven, I'd say.
1772.32|1773.76|Now, that's the farthest that he went to school.
1775.2|1781.35|And there wasn't much emphasis put on education in those days.
1782.09|1786.28|You know, it wasn't important that you had an education.
1786.46|1789.1|I don't know how Zip started back to school.
1789.7|1791.25|He became a teacher.
1792.63|1801.2|And Leona got her grade nine, I think, and grade eight in the convent.
1801.22|1804.55|And then she went to high school in Halbrite and got her grade nine.
1804.59|1806.19|I think that's as far as she went.
1808.29|1810.19|And then she went to California.
1811.17|1816.54|And Sister Hilary, of course, went through high school and became a teacher.
1816.56|1817.96|And Sister Aloysia, the same.
1818.78|1820.3|Charles and all those guys.
1821.56|1826.09|I don't think any of them had a grade 8 education.
1827.77|1836.38|You could read and write and know your arithmetic, and that's as far as it went.
1836.4|1838.42|I've been talking steady for a half hour.
1838.44|1839.4|I'll take a rest now.
1842.72|1845.75|This is the morning of July the 23rd.
1848.19|1859.69|I have a few minutes to go before I go for coffee, so I'll just continue about the years before 1924.
1862.86|1865.31|You may think from what I said that we never had any fun.
1865.33|1867.2|It was all work, work, work all the time.
1867.26|1869.38|Life was simple.
1871.02|1872.14|We made our own fun.
1873.34|1875.62|When I was growing up and got to be a teenager,
1875.66|1880.07|you'd go to a schoolhouse dance two or three times a year.
1880.11|1884.55|There'd be dances in town that you'd attend.
1886.11|1888.42|No drinking or anything at dancing in those days.
1888.76|1890.64|It was all very primitive.
1895.57|1898.95|You never saw your neighbors during the week.
1898.97|1901.45|Only once a week that people would gather together.
1902.26|1903.0|The rest of the time
1903.02|1906.97|you just did your routine daily work.
1906.99|1919.8|On the weekend, in the summertime, you'd get together and work up a ball team between a bunch of the neighbors and play, work up baseball, and that's where you whiled away the day.
1920.36|1922.98|Every other Sunday, we went to Mass in Halbrite.
1923.14|1929.65|That took two or three hours out of the center of the day.
1931.44|1933.32|Life was very, very ordinary.
1933.36|1936.48|In the summer, there would be picnics here and there that you'd attend.
1938.35|1940.77|But you just went along.
1942.13|1949.7|And I don't know whether you enjoyed life or not, but everybody did the same thing, and that's the way it was.
1955.46|1960.33|This is now on July the 20th, or August the 22nd.
1963.6|1965.68|So I'll try to continue.
1965.74|1970.91|I'm getting the story a bit mixed up, but I'll go back to 1924.
1971.01|1981.75|There I mentioned that our crop was fair and that Dad had died that year.
1983.89|1987.18|And I'll go back and tell the story of when Dad died.
1988.02|1992.54|The fall of '23, Mother had gone to California.
1993.33|1996.96|Yes, she went by herself.
1998.44|2001.79|And Leona stayed home to keep house.
2001.85|2003.35|It was Mac and Leona and I.
2003.47|2006.69|Bud was away to the convent.
2006.71|2007.84|Dad was there with us.
2009.86|2011.7|And Dad and I were hauling grain.
2011.78|2014.4|We had a big crop that year, and we were hauling grain.
2014.43|2015.31|There was no snow.
2015.33|2017.15|We were hauling with wagons all winter.
2018.87|2022.4|And he always complained that he wasn't feeling well.
2023.0|2027.4|I would go and load the grain after the chores was done in the morning.
2027.47|2033.01|I would load the grain, and then he and I would haul it to town.
2036.01|2037.0|Slow process.
2037.48|2040.22|A team of horses moving at about three miles an hour.
2040.26|2047.71|So it took you about three hours to make the trip, or more than that, four hours to make the trip to town and back.
2048.61|2050.17|And then it was chores time again.
2051.08|2052.12|We kept that up.
2052.22|2055.42|Finally, he said one day, "I'm going up to Griffin to see the doctor."
2056.95|2059.43|When he came home, I said, "What did the doctor say?"
2059.45|2063.31|"Oh, the doctor said, just a broken down old piece of machinery."
2065.31|2067.8|So he accepted that and kept on going.
2067.82|2075.3|And a couple of weeks later, he still wasn't feeling well, so he went to Kenmare, North Dakota, where there were some renowned doctors.
2077.24|2079.47|And he was gone.
2081.17|2085.65|a week, and we hadn't heard anything from him, or of him, I should say.
2086.3|2092.44|And finally we got a card that he had been admitted to the hospital as a patient.
2092.46|2096.15|And following that, the next day we got a phone call that somebody had better come down.
2096.21|2097.33|He's a pretty sick man.
2098.75|2100.41|So I caught the train that night.
2103.9|2106.06|I didn't have any money or anything.
2106.1|2108.97|I went to the banker, and the banker was a good friend of Dad's.
2109.65|2112.66|So he gave me money to make the trip.
2112.68|2119.63|When I got to Kenmare about two o'clock in the morning, well, I phoned the hospital and they said he was resting fine.
2120.67|2126.72|And the next morning when I got up and I went to the hospital and I got there, they said, "Your dad just passed away."
2128.74|2133.41|So there I was with a dead father and didn't know which way to turn.
2135.53|2138.82|So I phoned back up to Halbrite and talked to my Aunt Mary.
2140.26|2147.51|And she sort of directed me to let the relatives in Iowa know about her mother in California.
2149.8|2155.05|And by that time, she had worked her way up to Oregon, was staying with my sister Emma.
2157.15|2161.81|So we got a hold of her there, and I went back home.
2164.84|2168.26|We had the body shipped back to Halbrite for burial, and
2168.97|2197.39|mother,  mother got there by train it's funny how you could move around in those days. She'd come all the way from portland and we only held the funeral two days, I think. She was there for the funeral. And then I was in charge of the farm starting right then and there so that was in 1924 and uh
2197.71|2199.79|Mac and I run the farm.
2199.85|2200.71|Bud was there.
2201.31|2206.57|Leona was there, but she went to California that winter again, so we were alone with Mother.
2210.78|2214.02|'25, good crop.
2214.04|2216.02|'26, good crop.
2218.67|2225.89|'26, some of the boys came up from California, and they thought Mother was paying me too much money.
2226.77|2236.9|I had got $1,000 for the year, and the next year I was to get $1,200.
2238.68|2246.03|And I got on my high horse, and I said if they thought that was too much, well, let somebody else run the farm and I'd go my own way.
2246.37|2255.1|And I headed for Iowa with my cousin Norbert Hemmer, who was up for the harvest.
2257.93|2259.62|Brother Mac took over the farm.
2260.16|2262.1|That was the fall of '26.
2263.56|2265.64|We had really had a bumper crop that year.
2268.39|2275.82|But I went back down to Iowa, and then from there on, I started doing anything.
2275.84|2278.22|I didn't know where I was going or what I was going to do.
2278.24|2280.26|I had a few hundred dollars in my pocket.
2282.4|2285.11|I got down to Iowa to where I had a lot of relatives.
2285.17|2289.97|I'd been visiting down there two years before that, so I knew all my relatives.
2291.63|2296.88|And I visited around for a while.
2298.48|2302.14|Finally, one day, they had the rain, and it got all icy.
2303.07|2304.85|And I knew the blacksmith in town.
2304.89|2307.77|He needed some help.
2307.79|2309.59|He said, "Anybody know how to nail
2309.82|2310.79|shoe on a horse?"
2310.95|2315.31|I said, "No, I don't know how to nail a shoe on a horse, but I know how to trim their feet."
2316.69|2322.0|So he started me trimming up their feet, and he would put on the shoes.
2323.18|2325.34|And we got along.
2325.4|2327.0|He was paying me $4 a day.
2327.08|2327.48|I don't know.
2327.52|2329.11|I worked there about a week, I guess.
2329.35|2330.39|That was the end of that.
2331.69|2334.97|Ice melted, and everything went back to normal again.
2336.66|2344.19|And then I hung around until right after the first of the year, and a line gang came in town.
2344.27|2348.93|They were revamping or rebuilding power lines.
2349.99|2359.53|Restubbing is what it was, a restubbing job, putting a new stub in beside the old pole to keep it from breaking off.
2361.28|2367.32|And through a tip, one of the girls in the cafe said, if you're looking for a job, I heard the boss say he's going to fire a guy.
2368.33|2370.59|So I went and asked the boss for a job.
2370.61|2373.47|And I, yeah, he says come to work tomorrow morning.
2375.1|2376.2|So away I went.
2376.3|2379.08|And I knew nothing about what I was doing.
2381.36|2391.2|And I would have liked to about wore my hands out the first couple of days digging holes through frost.
2392.46|2398.39|The fourth day, I - all of a sudden I got the knack of it, and I got a hold of a set of better tools.
2398.97|2406.15|I dug as many holes as anybody the fourth day, and the fifth day I dug more holes than anybody, and I never looked back from there on.
2407.84|2417.6|I was getting thirty-five cents an hour, working nine hours a day, paying my own room and board, which you could get anyplace for a dollar a day.
2418.83|2421.61|So I was making about what, uh 3 times 20 -
2422.63|2427.7|making a little over $3 a day and paying $1 a day for room and board.
2428.1|2432.21|I had - In the meantime, I had bought a car, a Model T Ford, for about $350.
2432.29|2435.79|Good, reliable car.
2438.12|2441.18|And then away I go, and I followed the outfit.
2441.2|2451.26|They moved away from Worthington, where we had started, and one day the boss come along and said, we're moving across the state, down near Sioux City, Iowa.
2451.64|2452.34|He said, "Do you want to
2453.47|2454.37|go along with us?"
2455.43|2456.55|Well, I said, "I will."
2456.71|2458.79|Oh, in the meantime, he had come along one day.
2458.81|2463.14|He said, "Look", he said, "I put in for a raise for you for 40 cents an hour.
2464.08|2467.02|And they turned it down at the head office.
2468.1|2472.61|I'm going to plug enough time that you'll get 40 cents an hour."
2472.89|2473.95|He said, "I'll plug your time."
2475.15|2476.35|He said, "I like the way you work."
2478.56|2484.24|When to get back, well, I said, "Yeah, I'll go across to Iowa, but I don't think I should have to dig any more holes."
2484.3|2488.17|I said, "I can dig more holes than anybody you've got around here.
2488.19|2490.95|It's time I learned something else about the business."
2490.97|2492.35|Well, he said, "You won't have to."
2492.37|2503.04|He said, "Well, I'll start you out on other work that you get to familiarize yourself with the building of lines."
2503.06|2506.18|So when we got over to, it was Homer, Nebraska,
2506.96|2510.7|just south of Sioux City, Iowa, where we were working.
2512.43|2523.84|And there I started doing other things, framing cross arms and helping set poles and tamping poles and lining poles and putting on cross arms.
2523.94|2531.31|And pretty soon we started stringing wire, and I knew a little bit about climbing poles because I'd fix telephones at home.
2533.1|2541.21|So I started climbing poles, and that was the start of my career as a lineman.
2541.23|2550.68|This takes us into about the first of March, 1927.
2551.56|2553.08|And it was spring down there.
2553.18|2560.55|Spring broke up early, and there was no snow there by the first of March.
2560.57|2561.91|It was real mild weather.
2563.89|2572.31|And then one Sunday, I took a notion to drive up to see my brother Lorry up at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, which is about 150 miles away.
2572.36|2577.01|And when I get up there, I found him in a terrible shape.
2577.03|2582.36|He had sciatica, and he had lost his wife the year before, and he had eight kids.
2582.94|2585.12|The oldest girl was about 17.
2585.16|2592.57|And the oldest boy was about 13.
2594.17|2598.31|So, oh, he was in a terrible way.
2598.33|2599.39|He could hardly walk.
2599.79|2603.62|Didn't know how he was going to get his crop in or anything.
2603.64|2610.52|So I said, "I'll quit my job, and I'll come up and I'll put your crop in for you," I said.
2610.54|2621.23|When I went back, told the foreman I was going to quit, and I said, "I like this work, but I don't like the life that's with it."
2621.25|2622.56|I said, "You're sort of a,
2624.05|2627.98|a transient wherever you go.", I said, "You're never in one place very long."
2629.94|2637.43|And I said, "I think I better leave it right now and start doing something else."
2637.71|2639.79|He said, "You'll leave it now, but you'll be back."
2640.39|2642.2|He said, "I know you.
2642.26|2643.0|You're the type.
2643.04|2646.14|You'll be back."
2646.16|2650.47|So I went back up to Sioux Falls and
2651.32|2654.21|took over - took charge of my brother's farm.
2655.95|2657.75|So I'll just rest for a moment now.
2661.35|2671.84|Well, after a pause and taking a bit of a rest, I'll start in at my brother's farm.
2673.2|2675.43|Now remember, I'm 25 years old.
2676.09|2678.85|I'd run the home place for three years.
2680.69|2686.43|So I was pretty well prepared to take charge of almost anything that come along.
2686.45|2693.36|I had never worked on a corn farm, and this was strictly corn, cattle, and hogs.
2693.38|2699.13|So instead of driving a six or eight horse outfit here, you were driving a two or a four.
2700.39|2706.08|And with his direction, I got everything done.
2706.1|2710.64|I planted the corn and checked the corn when you planted
2710.98|2725.17|you have a wire that you string along and it trips every 36 inches it trips the corn into the ground but you have to keep that lined up that you can cultivate it both ways.
2725.17|2742.69|Everything went fine we got along good and had his crop all in the corn cultivated and everything going fine, and then July all of a sudden about the middle of July here comes a hail storm.
2742.69|2746.07|And it just knocked everything to pieces.
2749.06|2751.2|Well, he didn't know what to do.
2751.22|2752.94|It knocked the old crop down.
2753.04|2756.27|He had 40 acres of oats almost ready for the binder.
2760.17|2765.32|Well, I said, "We'll call in the neighbors and mow her down, stack her up."
2765.34|2767.24|So I called in the neighbors.
2768.56|2775.81|We mowed down the 40 acres in a hurry and had it all stacked up and everything, and now I'm finished.
2776.17|2793.72|In the meantime, I'd been - while I was in Iowa, my cousin from Nebraska, David City, Nebraska, said, when you're down in our part of the country, come and see us.
2794.42|2798.29|So I had been in touch with them, and they said harvest was coming on there.
2798.49|2801.46|Why didn't I come down and help them harvest?
2801.48|2802.28|So I did that.
2802.3|2806.59|I went down, and they were right in the throes of cutting the grain.
2806.65|2810.71|In those days, they still cut it with the binders, with horses and binders.
2813.02|2815.12|And we thrashed.
2815.28|2819.05|I was a stooker, setting up stooks.
2820.43|2823.51|And when that was finished, well, we started then thrashing.
2823.53|2829.42|The neighbors had an outfit, and I hauled bundles on that thrashing outfit.
2829.44|2831.54|And we got all the crops thrashed.
2833.09|2844.1|Well, there were some experiences on that that would make you smile if you knew what kind of a - an ornery bugger I was.
2846.36|2846.93|The guy -
2847.46|2851.13|he wouldn't move the machine, and I was pitching in the dust all day long.
2852.37|2856.17|So I got mad in the afternoon, and I filled that machine so damn full of straw.
2856.19|2857.71|I took him an hour to clean it out.
2858.87|2862.14|And then he got mad at me.
2862.4|2863.0|He gave me hell.
2863.06|2866.56|I said, "If you knew anything about an outfit, I couldn't plug the machine."
2867.34|2872.43|Well, he said, "If you know so much about it, let's see you set it that you can't plug it."
2872.45|2875.03|So I said, "Get me a pliers and a wrench, and I'll set her."
2875.87|2876.71|So I set it.
2876.88|2883.96|that you couldn't plug it no how. The feeder would stop if it got coming in too fast.
2883.96|2892.3|Well, he never said anything until after I left it came back to me that he said, "I guess that guy did know something about a thrashing outfit."
2892.3|2906.02|Well, we finished there and then I headed north I didn't know where I was going I stopped in at my brother's place in Sioux Falls and I had an uncle up near Aberdeen South Dakota so I
2906.53|2907.73|I knew the oldest boy.
2907.79|2908.81|I'd met him in Iowa.
2909.07|2909.87|He was just my age.
2911.61|2917.26|So I went up there, and when I got up there, well, it was just haying time.
2917.28|2918.7|They were not in -
2918.72|2923.32|well, they had been doing some harvesting.
2923.35|2926.09|Anyway, I said I was looking for a job.
2926.11|2927.99|I'd like to run the thrashing outfit.
2928.01|2929.31|This is what I was after.
2929.33|2934.38|So they turned me on to an outfit.
2934.4|2936.38|It was the best thrasher in the country.
2938.16|2943.87|So I drove up there, brave as hell, 25 years old, applied for the job.
2944.13|2949.78|Oh, he said, I'm sorry, I just engaged a fellow this afternoon.
2952.02|2959.57|But on Saturday, we're running through some oats to have horse feed for the thrashers.
2960.55|2962.8|And come on up anyway.
2962.82|2967.46|Well, I went up, and as it was, the other guy didn't turn up.
2969.05|2988.31|So we started thrashing, and we hadn't gone ten minutes, I don't think, and all of a sudden, biffity-bang, and pieces started flying, and part of the concave, that's the part that does the thrashing in the front of the machine, had broke loose and gone into the blower, smashed up the blower and everything.
2988.35|2991.53|He was a Scandinavian fellow.
2991.57|2996.42|He said, "Okay, he said, you fix up the front end, I fix up the back end."
2997.87|3011.52|Well, I found out that they had overhauled the separator, and they hadn't set the concaves right in them, and one of them dropped out, had went through into the blower and bent things up badly back there.
3011.82|3015.33|He got that all straightened out, and in an hour and a half, we were thrashing again.
3017.01|3017.79|He come to me.
3017.81|3020.29|He said, "I think we'll get along okay."
3021.61|3025.14|He says, "You, you come back when we start thrashing.
3025.2|3026.04|You've got the job."
3027.89|3029.83|Well, the wages were ten dollars a day.
3030.67|3033.02|Ten, room and board, which was big money at that time.
3034.98|3038.06|Well, his brother ran the engine, and I ran the separator.
3040.44|3044.21|And we thrashed twelve hours a day, thrashing belt time.
3044.23|3046.43|He said, "I don't want this machine to stop, ever.
3046.95|3049.78|For twelve hours a day, I want it to be turning.
3051.18|3053.02|As long as the belts are turning, I get paid."
3055.34|3056.02|We thrashed
3057.42|3060.0|- what was it - 29 out of 31 days.
3060.3|3062.09|We thrashed right through Sundays and all.
3062.11|3066.65|We got laid out twice for showers of rain.
3066.67|3076.64|And in that time, I only had an hour and a half lost time with the separator, and the engineer, he had about two hours lost time with his engine.
3076.66|3084.89|That was all the lost time we had, thrashing 12 hours a day.
3084.91|3085.37|You ate
3086.6|3087.72|lunch on the run.
3089.16|3090.74|In the mornings, you always had lunch.
3091.4|3095.93|At noon, you stopped for half an hour for dinner.
3095.95|3099.43|In the afternoon, you had donuts and coffee again.
3099.45|3105.34|And then you'd thrash right through until about 6.30 or 7 o'clock at night.
3105.36|3108.4|Then you had to do all your belt lacing and everything like that.
3108.42|3110.74|I hardly ever got to bed before midnight.
3110.76|3113.94|And at 4.30 in the morning, he was there calling again.
3114.02|3116.17|His call was, oh, I must
3116.62|3145.41|relate that we slept in the barns and the bedding you were furnished, was a horse blanket and you can make your own bed out of hay or however you want it and my way of sleeping was right on the hard floor with a little straw under my head for a pillow. I'd take off all my clothes at night shake them out I wore high top boots,
3146.69|3152.66|take them off, put everything back on, excepting my high-top boots, and lay down.
3152.68|3167.23|And by the time you had slept, say, four and a half hours, and he was, his call was, "Daylight in the swamp, boys." and you were glad to get up after laying on the hard floor for four hours.
3167.81|3173.26|Well, that was the way I slept for a month, right on the hard floor.
3173.3|3174.84|No, just the horse blanket,
3175.55|3178.31|laying on it and used half of it to cover me.
3180.07|3186.76|However, that season wound up.
3186.78|3191.16|I picked up my $300 or whatever it was.
3194.17|3198.29|And then I headed north -
3198.31|3201.22|yeah, then I was home since - now it's fall.
3201.57|3204.05|I wanted to come to Canada and see the family.
3204.07|3209.3|So I come up to Canada to see the family, driving my Model T Ford.
3211.44|3216.78|And let me get ahead of myself now.
3216.8|3218.48|I have to stop right now and think.
3219.98|3221.82|Yes, I headed north for Canada.
3222.95|3225.01|I spent a couple of weeks up home, and then
3226.85|3232.86|driving back to South Dakota, down to where my uncle lived at Frederick, out of Aberdeen, South Dakota.
3234.62|3237.08|I rolled my car, went to sleep at the wheel.
3237.12|3239.44|I was driving straight through in the middle of the night.
3239.8|3242.23|About daylight in the morning, I rolled my car.
3243.21|3244.47|The luckiest guy in the world.
3244.57|3249.48|Smashed all the glass in it, and I never even got a bruise or a cut.
3251.75|3258.08|Well, I went into Valley City, and I patched it up enough that I could drive another hundred miles down to my uncle's place.
3260.15|3270.29|So while I was there, my cousin said, hey, there's a power gang working down here at Leola, about 25 miles from there.
3271.65|3273.39|He said, "They're building a power line in there."
3273.45|3274.57|Maybe we could get a job.
3274.59|3275.1|So I -
3278.4|3284.65|He and I go on down there one afternoon, and by God, I go in the hotel and talk to the foreman.
3284.69|3287.11|He was half drunk.
3287.13|3289.19|Told him what experience I had.
3289.21|3291.1|He said, "You come to work Monday morning."
3293.16|3294.68|And I went to work.
3294.7|3296.12|Frank Wenner was his name.
3296.6|3303.13|A Finlander, about five foot two, and weighed about 180 pounds.
3303.37|3308.34|He reminded me of Uncle Wally for build.
3309.38|3314.85|Anyway, he wasn't a guy that went out on the job.
3314.89|3318.21|He stayed in the hotel and stayed drunk and let the crew run their own.
3319.23|3322.68|He had a foreman that would run the crew.
3322.7|3332.67|Well, when we got from Leola, we went up to Frederick, and I was acquainted with Frederick, and he knew that, so he used to keep me in about every second day to go out and buy him a bottle of whiskey.
3333.23|3335.36|Everything was home brew.
3335.4|3339.1|The country was dry, so you had to go out and buy bootleg liquor.
3340.8|3345.15|And he took a liking to me somehow, and he always favored me.
3346.79|3350.68|From there we moved over into Dawson, North Dakota.
3350.7|3354.5|This was the middle of the winter, oh, maybe in about February.
3355.96|3359.53|And in Dawson, North Dakota, we were there building lines.
3361.59|3363.27|He took pneumonia and died.
3364.85|3367.96|So they brought in another foreman, a fellow by the name of Bill Oberts.
3369.76|3372.5|And Bill was a quiet type of a guy.
3372.52|3374.33|He didn't go out to the job much either.
3374.39|3380.54|He relied on his foreman bringing in reports to him.
3380.56|3386.81|By this time, I'm pretty well recognized in the outfit now.
3386.82|3395.66|I'm in with the linemen, the guys that are four or five linemen, and I was semi with them.
3395.68|3398.18|And we kept on going and going, and -
3401.72|3406.43|Then we split up the crew and they get another foreman.
3406.45|3409.07|And this fellow, he took a liking to me.
3409.1|3411.3|He's a younger man.
3411.32|3417.75|He taught me an awful lot about line work and gave me a lot of breaks.
3419.49|3425.28|Then they put two crews together and we built a heavy line from
3426.14|3432.89|Thunder Hawk, South Dakota, up to Elgin, North Dakota, about 40 miles across.
3432.91|3434.51|And I mean no man's land.
3434.53|3442.4|There wasn't a damn thing in there but hills up and down, up and down, and up and down.
3442.74|3449.65|And in the meantime, they had bought a boring machine to bore the holes instead of digging them by hand.
3452.43|3455.98|So they saw they were behind schedule, so they decided to run the outfit
3456.53|3458.49|the boring machine 24 hours a day.
3458.52|3468.37|And my friend, Elmer Jones, who was a lineman also, he got the job running the boring machine.
3468.39|3475.18|So the foreman didn't know who he could get for a second man, and the timekeeper was a good friend of mine and knew me pretty well.
3475.2|3480.12|He said, "You put Achen on that machine, he'll run it."
3480.14|3483.25|So I was put on the boring machine, which was, well,
3483.6|3494.92|one of the top-matched jobs on the outfit, and had a lot of experience with that machine.
3495.52|3503.21|It wasn't what machines are today, but it had its abilities and it had its disabilities.
3504.55|3507.94|It required a lot of maintenance, and I was good at that.
3507.96|3509.32|I had the experience
3510.04|3515.65|on machines from the farm, so I had no trouble getting along with them.
3515.67|3519.36|However, in the meantime, harvest comes along.
3519.38|3527.07|My old thrasher up in South Dakota, he gets word to me, he wants me to come back up there to run his separator, and he'll give me $12 a day.
3529.35|3536.42|So I leave the outfit, and I go up back to Frederick to...
3537.46|3538.12|to thrash.
3538.16|3539.85|Well, we had a bad fall.
3539.87|3545.44|It rained a lot, and a lot of lost time and whatnot.
3546.82|3549.46|I wasn't doing too well financially.
3549.48|3556.91|Well, I was making my $12 a day on the thrash and nothing, room and board only when we didn't thrash.
3556.93|3561.38|So we finished that job, and then my uncle had a machine just like it.
3561.4|3564.38|It was a sort of a crop machine. Four farmers owned it.
3567.57|3593.79|<backwards it erases everything and I'm still finding out> - papers well we finished thrashing there we only thrashed about 10 or 12 days and then I, I was finished and I didn't know where I was going or what I was going to do so I jumped in the car and I started heading for Canada.
3595.77|3603.08|I got up as far as Minot, North Dakota, and I stopped in the city there to see if I could get a job.
3604.64|3606.64|"Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.
3606.66|3609.21|Come and get a job here, working in the city."
3610.23|3614.74|That was on a Saturday, I guess, or a Friday.
3616.52|3621.05|And ,"report to work for Monday morning."
3621.17|3622.35|So Monday morning, I
3623.14|3629.43|Well, in the meantime, on Saturday and Sunday, I went around, and I looked, and, oh, boy, I thought, I'm getting ahead of myself here.
3629.53|3633.23|This is pretty heavy stuff, pretty hot stuff.
3633.25|3634.49|I'll be working in here.
3634.55|3639.06|So come Monday morning, I never reported for work.
3639.08|3641.12|I got in the car, and I headed up for Canada.
3642.36|3651.25|I hadn't got up the road 50 miles, and here I come across a small line gang working right along the highway, so I stopped and,
3652.04|3661.02|and I got talking to them, and I got talking to the foreman, and I told him who I was and what I'd been doing, and he said, "You looking for a job?"
3661.12|3664.26|Well, I said, I'm out of a job right now.
3666.12|3671.53|Well, he said, my head man is leaving here, and he said, "I haven't got a good experienced man on the crew."
3671.61|3672.55|He only had about -
3685.73|3686.55|waiting for you.
3686.57|3692.65|So I go up to Kenmare and I go into the office and tell him that I'd been talking to Leo O'Grady, a foreman.
3694.28|3695.86|He said that he would take me on.
3695.98|3698.78|So they said report to work on Monday morning.
3698.8|3705.57|My wages were 87 cents an hour and I paid my own room and board.
3705.59|3713.35|Well, again, it was something else to go in an outfit and right away you're made the head man.
3713.57|3721.6|I didn't have that much experience under my belt, but I had a lot of confidence and a lot of ability.
3721.64|3728.65|I had been taught something about working hotline work, had done some hotline work.
3728.91|3730.95|So, and - the foreman and I got along very good.
3731.17|3733.91|He was an Irishman and full of humor.
3737.62|3740.76|Right away, I was the top man on the job.
3742.22|3746.37|That was in November, early November, yeah.
3746.39|3747.25|I started working then.
3747.31|3748.35|I worked all winter.
3750.07|3752.33|We were what they called the flying squad.
3752.35|3767.63|We had 150 miles of line from Mohall, North Dakota, over into the last town going out of North Dakota on the other side, Mohall -
3768.21|3769.43|Mohall was on the east
3770.57|3775.84|and somewhere past Crosby, about 30 miles, was the end of our last territory.
3776.46|3778.28|We were what they called the flying squad.
3778.36|3783.65|If there was trouble anyplace, they blew the whistle, and we went there and took care of it.
3783.67|3787.79|And I had some real good experience on that job in a matter of a few months.
3789.57|3798.72|And everything was going fine until while we were working in Crosby, North Dakota, and one night they pound at the door and it was the immigration -
3799.58|3823.21|he said, "We've got a lot of unemployment in this country", and he said, "You can't work down here unless you get a permit to work here."
3823.69|3826.23|He said, "You'd better go to into Portal and report to
3826.78|3832.55|the chief immigration officer in there and see what he's got to say about it."
3832.57|3846.96|So he took me into a Portal and that night and the next morning I went down to see the immigration chief and told him the story.
3846.98|3848.58|"Ah, " he said, "You can't work down here."
3848.64|3851.3|He said, "We've got to deport you."
3851.32|3854.11|He said, "We'll allow you to make a willful deportation."
3855.47|3864.38|You just sign this card here that you're willfully deporting yourself from the United States, and that's the end of your working down here.
3865.91|3875.78|Well, to get ahead of the story, in the fall when I had gone back up to visit, Mother wanted to get off the farm.
3876.12|3878.34|Bud was tired of the farm.
3878.36|3881.21|So Brother Mac and I were going to rent the farm.
3881.27|3882.09|We drew up a
3883.15|3887.07|a deal or an arrangement whereby we would take over -
3895.67|3908.23|- so. That was all cut and dried, so when they said, "You better skidoo back up to Canada," I had no qualms.
3908.33|3911.23|I went up there and immediately got a job -
3912.59|3915.82|or had a job, I should say, on the farm.
3916.64|3917.7|We were going farming.
3919.74|3921.36|And that was all there was to that.
3921.78|3924.93|Now I've got to stop and revamp it again for a while.
3929.81|3934.18|Now we're up to September the 11th, 1986.
3935.46|3940.3|This is about three weeks ago when I last spoke into this thing.
3940.32|3942.15|Well, anyway, to get back to the story,
3943.42|3945.09|Mac and I farmed that year.
3945.19|3946.19|We put in the crop.
3947.17|3948.51|We didn't have a very big crop.
3948.53|3949.81|It was kind of a dry year.
3950.61|3958.21|That was the summer of 1924, my first year of running the farm.
3958.35|3963.73|Mother was paying me $600 for the year and of course I had the use of the car as I needed it.
3966.42|3967.34|Everything went fine.
3967.4|3972.49|We got our crop in and we were ahead of everything and we had an early harvest.
3974.22|3998.31|When the harvest was finished, a buddy of mine and myself got in the car one Saturday, and we were going out for a little fun, and went down to Estevan, and the country was dry at that time, and so we landed in on the bootleggers, and having a drink in there when another friend of ours from our hometown came in and got talking. I asked what he's doing.
3998.33|4001.51|He said he's working with the power gang.
4001.53|4002.91|Well, I said, "My God, I said..."
4003.06|4006.36|get me a job," I said.
4006.49|4009.57|This was about, well, I'd say about the middle of September.
4010.79|4012.55|And he said, "Sure."
4012.93|4017.2|The boss was saying the other day that he could stand another man.
4017.22|4018.78|He's going away to university.
4020.44|4029.29|So that was on a weekend, and Monday night I had a phone call from him saying, come on down, go to work. So,
4029.82|4038.22|I had packed up my bag, which was the climbing tools and a few wrenches and a hammer, and I head for Estevan.
4039.36|4039.96|And go down there.
4040.0|4043.46|The wages were set, I think it was 83 cents an hour.
4044.04|4045.19|Paid my own room and board.
4045.39|4051.82|We were working 10 hours a day, six days a week.
4051.84|4055.66|However, I got on this job, and they were a very inexperienced crew.
4055.72|4059.75|None of them knew very much about building a line and
4060.74|4068.23|the foreman immediately recognized that I knew more than anybody around there, and he come to me and said, I should make you foreman of this crew.
4068.33|4069.07|I'm going away.
4070.67|4076.72|But he said, "I've already promised it to Jack, and I hate to go back on my word."
4077.6|4082.2|Well, I said, "I'll tell you, John, I just come down here to run a few dollars."
4082.76|4089.23|I said, "I'm farming, and I'll just be working here for a few months probably and back to the farm again.
4090.12|4100.33|So you just go ahead and leave things the way they are, and I'll continue to do my best.
4100.47|4103.81|Whenever I get ready to leave, I'll just leave, that's all."
4103.83|4113.52|Well, as things worked out then, it wasn't very long, and the superintendent from downtown, and he picked me out right away.
4113.64|4117.85|He said, "I'm going to let the district serviceman go and
4118.74|4120.66|put you in on service work."
4120.68|4123.09|I said, "My God, I don't even know how to read a meter.
4124.51|4126.13|All I know is how to build a line."
4127.45|4131.08|He said, "We'll teach you that." He said.
4131.1|4133.42|"Well," I said, "I might be leaving here in the spring.
4136.06|4141.81|And then you'll have to get somebody else."
4141.83|4142.97|"Well," he said, "that's okay.
4143.01|4146.94|We'll deal with that when it comes."
4146.96|4148.34|Well, anyway, I
4150.5|4163.3|I go on to service work, changing meters and servicing customers and reading meters and all the things that go along with service work.
4163.32|4164.64|I worked there all winter.
4169.83|4175.46|Yeah, I work all winter, and then when spring comes, I go back home -
4175.86|4177.06|that's right -
4177.84|4183.44|about the end of March, I go back home on the farm.
4183.46|4188.81|By that time, Mother and Bud had their fill of living in the city, living in Weyburn.
4190.01|4197.28|And Mother wanted to get back on the farm, so we just canceled our contract, and Mother went back on the farm.
4197.34|4201.51|In the meantime, I head back to Estevan to see if I can get a job.
4202.59|4204.92|And they had brought another crew in there, their building.
4205.52|4207.32|It had quite a lot of construction going on.
4207.81|4211.79|They're building a new power plant there, and they had brought another crew in.
4213.15|4214.09|So they put me on.
4214.11|4218.14|Oh, I go down and - that's right -
4218.16|4219.76|I go down, and I talk to the foreman.
4219.8|4221.46|I said, "What are my wages going to be?"
4221.48|4222.96|He said, "55 cents an hour."
4222.98|4226.07|I said, "Hell, I'm not working for 55 cents an hour."
4226.45|4228.49|I got 83 last fall when I left here.
4230.15|4232.14|"Well," he said, "I didn't set those wages.
4232.2|4234.4|That was the superintendent that set that."
4235.46|4236.9|"Well," I said, "I'll tell you.
4238.92|4267.58|I'll work here until he comes down and then I'll talk to him." "Well," he said, "When I saw your work and saw your work he said I right away told the superintendent you were worth more money than that and he finally said I'll give you 75 cents an hour. "Well,", I said, "From now on I'll just do 75 cents an hour worth of work every hour that you'll have to
4268.37|4271.05|put up with that until he gets down here."
4271.07|4272.96|Well, it was about a month later when he comes down.
4275.04|4285.73|In the meantime, this foreman had left and gone to one of the mines, and another foreman came in and took over.
4285.75|4288.76|And when the superintendent come down, I'm really up in the air.
4288.78|4292.76|I'm going to eat him out good.
4292.78|4294.66|So I heard he was in town.
4296.1|4298.48|He was looking for me, and I was looking for him.
4300.12|4302.92|He said, "Hey, Linden, I want to see you."
4302.94|4305.39|He said, "I want you to run the crew."
4306.43|4308.15|"Well," I said, "What's happened?"
4308.19|4313.36|He said, "Bill Wilson broke his leg this afternoon, and we've got to have somebody to run the crew, and I'm picking you."
4313.38|4314.92|He said, "Do you think you can run the crew?"
4314.96|4316.52|I said, "You think I can?"
4316.6|4318.84|He said, "yes, I do."
4318.86|4319.52|I said, "okay."
4319.54|4321.93|And he said, "Your wages will be 87 cents an hour."
4322.79|4324.87|Well, that's settled the wage argument right there.
4325.71|4328.37|I put that crew through the paces all summer.
4328.4|4331.52|I had eight men, and they were good men but
4331.96|4335.54|we really went through a lot of work.
4335.56|4346.88|We finished the job at Estevan and then moved up to - down near the Assiniboia area and did some work, then up to Craik and Davidson, worked there for a while, and then up to Biggar.
4346.92|4348.56|Now, Biggar is a town about 3,000.
4348.78|4354.59|We were totally rebuilding the distribution system in there.
4354.61|4354.79|And,
4355.14|4356.54|I had no problem at all.
4356.7|4358.32|Everything was going good.
4358.34|4376.5|When this man Wilson, who had broke his leg in the spring, was ready to come back to work, and Doboy's superintendent had come up to Biggar.
4376.52|4382.18|He said, "I want you to come back to Estevan and put Bill back in charge of the crew, and I want you to come back to Estevan.
4382.2|4383.97|I've got a job for you down there."
4384.2|4392.97|He said, "We're cutting the whole town over from 2,300 volts to 4,000 volts, and I want you to do the job."
4392.99|4399.86|Well, I went down there, and I had one man helping me, and I cut the whole town over, which had to be done in sections.
4399.88|4412.94|You cut one section after the other and kept crowding the higher voltage behind you and cutting off the lower voltage sections and cutting over all the transformers and everything as you went along.
4412.96|4413.6|It was a good experience.
4415.81|4429.07|I finished that job, and then he had to do an odd job around until January when an ad came in the paper that the Power Commission were hiring men.
4429.09|4430.75|And so I went to the superintendent.
4430.77|4435.37|I said, "Look, I'm about finished here."
4435.55|4439.98|I said, "Maybe I should apply for a job there."
4440.08|4443.41|He said - And I said, "What would it mean if I called them?"
4443.43|4445.63|"Well," he said, "They'll be here long after we're gone." he said,
4446.65|4450.84|"The government starts taking over, they'll take over."
4450.86|4453.04|So I came to Regina -
4453.22|4459.05|Oh, I wrote in, that's right.
4459.07|4466.48|I wrote in and asked for a job and forgot all about it.
4466.5|4469.69|I go out - out of town.
4469.95|4476.15|I had run into a pretty nice schoolmarmie out in the country, and I was out visiting her.
4476.96|4483.33|And I didn't know where she lived, and I got into this small town to phone and see where she was at.
4483.55|4487.94|While I was there, the telephone operator said to me, are you Lindy Achen?
4488.0|4488.58|I said, "Yes."
4488.66|4491.5|But she said, "They've been trying to get a hold of you from Estevan."
4491.52|4497.11|Well, I hadn't told a soul that I was going out that night.
4498.09|4502.33|But the telephone operators in those days, it wasn't automatic like it is today.
4502.6|4509.3|Telephone operators kept very close track of what was going on when a long distance come for me from Regina.
4509.32|4525.68|They had heard me phone this girl that I was coming out, and so they phoned the operator there and said, if Lindy Achen is in the district there in any place, trace him down.
4526.22|4530.12|And they had swum out to where this girl was teaching, and I wasn't there.
4530.92|4533.35|However, I get on the phone.
4533.37|4540.47|I phoned back to Regina to this number, and here's the superintendent up in Regina here.
4540.49|4541.51|He wants me to come in in two days.
4542.43|4546.3|They're hiring five men, and I was one of the five to pick them up.
4546.32|4553.32|And they put us through a fast two-day course of the book work and everything, and then put our...
4554.55|4573.78|service work and I was posted to Saskatoon which was a Class B district my wages were $155 a month. I had my own car and I used my car on the job and I got 10 cents a mile for driving for using my own vehicle.
4575.17|4577.8|Well, I was up there, many things happened.
4578.08|4580.84|The superintendent was a young green superintendent.
4580.86|4584.59|He didn't know anything about power lines, just out of university.
4585.99|4591.9|So he relied a lot on me for information when there was trouble and whatnot.
4591.92|4593.55|And I worked there about four months.
4595.07|4598.96|He was pretty impressed with the job that I was doing.
4598.98|4600.66|And the man that they had sent to the
4601.47|4606.61|class one district at Rosetown with a university graduate.
4606.63|4610.02|But he got down there and he really got things mixed up good.
4611.88|4616.17|So my superintendent said to me one day, how'd you like to be transferred to Rosetown?
4616.19|4618.45|I said, "If I get his wages, yes, I will."
4619.77|4621.7|So I go down there and I knew the fellow.
4622.52|4629.35|He had got into the bottle quite a bit and wasn't paying attention to his job and he had everything mixed up.
4630.03|4634.5|Well, I took over Rosetown and more or less took charge of things.
4634.74|4636.34|Well, I had my district there.
4636.36|4637.7|I had eight towns to look after.
4638.91|4645.45|And they'd all been built in the wintertime and everything was hanging crooked and leaning crooked.
4645.47|4650.68|So as I had spare time, I'd hire a kid and help me and get this all straightened out.
4652.26|4658.91|And then one day I got a letter from the superintendent eating me out as the superintendent in Regina, eating me out for
4659.7|4661.3|hiring help without authority.
4661.32|4665.09|I was paying these kids 30 cents an hour.
4666.47|4669.25|And - doing a good job.
4669.27|4670.72|We got a lot of work done.
4671.22|4681.65|Then when he saw what a job I had been doing in the towns, then he turned around and made all the other district men do what I had been doing.
4681.67|4689.2|Well, along with that and a few other things that happened, I was young and, what would you say, young and free and wild.
4690.89|4692.95|I had money in the bank.
4692.97|4695.15|I had bought a brand new car while I was there.
4696.69|4702.08|So I said I wanted a leave of absence. That was about the end of September.
4702.1|4704.72|Wanted leave of absence for three months.
4705.38|4707.72|"Oh, we don't have such a thing in the books."
4709.81|4716.79|"Well," I said, "I'll take it off and take my own chances of getting back to work when I get back."
4716.81|4719.15|So, okay, I check out,
4719.62|4724.11|when I came to Regina, I stopped in the head off at the head superintendent.
4724.13|4728.72|He said, "Boy, you've done an ace-high job for us."
4728.74|4733.06|He says, "We have nothing but praise for the work that you've done.
4733.14|4738.61|But we can't guarantee you that you'll have a job when you come back in the spring, because things are getting tougher all the time."
4738.63|4740.49|This is in the spring of 1931.
4740.59|4746.12|No, in the fall of 1931.
4747.1|4747.84|And anyway...
4749.07|4752.9|The way I go, I go down to Halbrite - Midale.
4752.92|4754.2|Mac was living in Midale.
4754.24|4756.97|Brother, Mac was living in Midale.
4757.05|4761.2|Midale wanted to put in a power plant.
4761.22|4765.53|And they said, "You're just the guy to come down here and put in our distribution system for us."
4766.25|4769.89|I said, "I want to take my mother down to Iowa for a month first."
4770.21|4771.45|Well, that would be plenty of time.
4771.47|4775.26|You get back here in November, that would be plenty of time to do so.
4775.54|4781.12|Mother and I went to Iowa, and I had a whooping time down in Iowa with all the relatives.
4781.14|4787.89|And I had been down there on a visit twice before that, so I knew a lot of people.
4787.91|4794.12|When I come back, I want to work in Iowa, or in Midale and put in the distribution system.
4794.14|4795.16|Got that done, done.
4795.39|4809.57|All the houses and stores had to be wired, so my brother Mac and I spent the winter there, wiring up these houses and stores and making money all the time, you know.
4812.42|4819.97|Well then, the job is finished, and it's spring.
4819.99|4824.67|So about in May, I wander up to Regina here,
4825.09|4829.14|going to the power commission.
4829.16|4832.38|See if I can get a job.
4832.8|4833.42|"Get a job?
4833.44|4839.31|We're still laying off men. Things are that tough that we're still laying off men. We're not hiring men."
4840.74|4844.21|So - and the superintendent got nasty with me then.
4844.27|4849.0|The guy that had praised me so much when I checked out, he said, "Oh, that's the kind of a guy you are.
4849.02|4853.78|You go and pick an inside job for the winter, and now you come back in the summer and want a job."
4854.37|4863.12|Well, he'll never know how close I come to climbing over his desk and punching him in the nose, but I held myself and walked out of his office.
4863.14|4874.94|And I went back to the farm and loafed around all summer, having a good time, helping on the farm, of course.
4874.96|4880.33|But that fall, we didn't have much harvest.
4881.27|4888.84|And we got our own work done up early with our own help, just Bud and my cousin Tad and a few of us.
4888.94|4893.72|We put our little thrashing outfit to work, and we got the harvests off of them.
4893.74|4899.67|There were others around the country that wanted to get thrashing done, so Bud hired me and the separator outfit.
4899.69|4903.88|These guys would have a tractor, and I'd run the outfits.
4905.08|4905.86|And for that,
4906.72|4919.12|He was getting $4 an hour or $40 a day for this separator and myself and the farmer who furnished the tractor, and I would run both ends.
4919.24|4921.62|I don't know what he was paying me, a couple bucks a day.
4922.9|4930.18|Oh, he must have gotten more than $4 a day, because he was paying me $2 or $3 a day, and he probably got $7 or $8 for the outfit.
4931.3|4938.21|And I worked there, and maybe three weeks doing that, and fall was in, and I got in the car.
4938.31|4944.34|In the meantime, in June, Dominion Electric knew I wasn't working.
4944.36|4944.96|They phoned me.
4944.98|4946.82|I went down there and worked for two weeks.
4947.2|4951.21|They had the job they wanted done, and I went to work for two weeks.
4951.23|4955.33|So I went back in the fall, and Dubois says, I can put you to work.
4955.35|4956.99|He says, we've got some work here.
4958.51|4963.63|So I worked in Estevan for about the month of October with the gang that was there.
4964.77|4976.03|And then they were putting in a power plant out of Hopkins, which was 18 miles from the nearest power plant, so they put in another isolated plant, a little diesel plant.
4976.87|4979.37|And he said, "I want you to go out there and build a distribution system."
4981.31|4984.3|And I knew the fellow was going to go out there and put the plant in.
4984.4|4987.6|They were setting up a small company, and he was leaving them.
4988.04|4994.97|He was a steam engineer from Estevan, and he was leaving them and going out to set up this small plant to get on his own.
4997.69|4999.55|I go out there, and I put in the distribution system.
4999.63|5001.47|Oh, it was a beautiful fall.
5001.49|5002.8|We went out there in November.
5002.82|5009.42|There was snow on the ground, but it all went away, and it was like summer until the middle of December.
5009.44|5012.49|And they got the plant going about the 17th of December.
5013.63|5016.61|Well, in that winter, I wired houses and
5016.96|5044.83|stores in that town all winter. So I was busy making a living and that was about all. Then the next spring my old company Dominion Electric Dubois hired me to go into Gull Lake. There was some bad wiring jobs and they couldn't meter it properly in three or four places involving business places. So I went in and I straightened all that out. And
5046.07|5050.52|when I got that finished, he took me up to Biggar, Saskatchewan.
5050.54|5052.24|It's up by Saskatoon.
5052.26|5060.09|There I did the hospital and three, four stores that had messes in the wiring and got it all straightened out.
5060.11|5064.93|And then I come back to Gull Lake and I started overhauling the distribution system.
5064.95|5068.6|And I worked there about three months in the summer.
5069.02|5069.78|All by myself.
5069.82|5072.8|I would have a helper for a half a day and that was all.
5073.08|5074.54|The rest of the time I was by myself,
5075.48|5080.37|and doing jobs that normally you'd put two or three men at.
5080.39|5091.5|When I finished that, I went down to the town of Eastend, which had another small decent plot, and down by Shaunavon.
5091.52|5104.5|And I worked there for a month, and all of a sudden, New York, who owned the Dominion Electric Power, said, "Cut all spending.
5104.68|5106.72|That's the end of it.
5106.74|5108.44|We can't spend any more money this year."
5109.0|5111.39|So I get a phone call to shut her down right then.
5111.41|5112.73|I was one-man crew again.
5112.77|5114.63|I could shut her down pretty easy.
5114.75|5123.3|But while I was there, I lined up a lot of wiring jobs, so I wired for three months - for a month in Eastend.
5123.32|5131.93|I had enough work to carry me on for a month, and then I went back up to Tompkins, where this friend of mine was running the power plant, and...
5132.5|5133.97|I tucked in there for the winter.
5133.99|5145.65|You'd get room and board for about, oh, a dollar and a half a day is what it would cost you to live.
5145.67|5152.86|And played cards and did some wiring around there that winter, odd jobs.
5155.2|5159.19|And then in the spring,
5159.88|5166.07|Oh yeah, then the next year I went out and I ran a crew for the Dominion Electric.
5167.91|5172.02|He hired me, Dominion Electric hired me back here and I went down.
5172.16|5176.26|I overhauled the power line from Shaunavon to Assiniboia for 120 miles.
5177.32|5182.67|We climbed every pole on that line and repaired everything that needed repairing.
5182.71|5185.38|I had three men and myself.
5187.16|5188.97|And we worked hard.
5188.99|5197.54|It was a hot, dry summer, but we kept on plugging away, working six and seven days a week.
5197.56|5199.42|And what was I getting then?
5199.54|5202.43|I was getting, I think, 50 cents an hour.
5203.63|5210.06|We worked a nine-hour day, so I'd make it $4.50 a day, and you could get room and board for a couple dollars a day.
5212.7|5216.71|I worked there until fall -
5216.71|5220.12|Yeah, we haven't finished the job when they shut her down again.
5220.18|5220.9|They got out of money.
5220.92|5224.33|So back to Tompkins I go again.
5225.35|5226.73|The pal was running a power plant.
5226.75|5228.59|But this time he was getting pretty dissatisfied.
5228.61|5234.72|Sitting in there watching that little 40-horse diesel chug, chug, chug, chug away.
5234.78|5238.41|Turning over 300 revolutions a minute.
5238.43|5240.15|And he was having trouble with it.
5240.17|5242.97|But he was not a good operator.
5243.01|5243.49|He...
5243.69|5248.36|He never fixed anything before it broke, put it that way.
5248.38|5252.63|So I saw he was dissatisfied and I asked him one day if he wanted to sell out.
5252.77|5256.56|Yeah, he said I'd be glad to get the hell out of here.
5256.58|5260.4|So I phoned Estevan and told him about it and they were glad to get rid of him.
5260.42|5262.23|They weren't happy with him as an operator.
5263.47|5287.1|So they said, "You go ahead and make the deal and tell us what you've worked up," and I told them and they gave me the money to swing the deal. I traded my car in. I borrowed 600 from my mother and here I was president of Tompkins Electric. Well, I was without transportation so in Dominion Electric my old superintendent saw that he said, "We've got to have some trucks standing down in the yard there.
5291.2|5294.54|It's not in good running order, but you'll make it work."
5294.56|5299.91|So they sent that up, and I had that half-ton truck when I was running the power plant.
5299.93|5305.04|Well, then my brother Mac was out of work, and I said, "I'm sorry."
5305.06|5308.79|He'd come up, he and his wife, they moved up.
5308.81|5311.29|And then right away, he learned how to run the power plant.
5311.31|5312.17|...
5312.19|5314.56|Well, then I was free to go out and do wiring and
5315.4|5321.87|I did odd jobs for Dominion Electric around the country. They whistled me out to do a job.
5321.95|5325.83|I went to different towns, would work a month at a time.
5326.83|5328.16|It wasn't making any money.
5328.26|5332.78|My salary when I run the power plant was $75 a month.
5332.8|5334.37|And that's all the plant could afford.
5334.39|5342.18|It just barely paid its way, paid interest and fuel and wages at $75 a month.
5343.64|5370.63|Well, I operated that for about a year and a half and then the company saw fit to build a line from Gull Lake to Tompkins and shut that down. Now we're into 1930 we're into 1930 - yeah I operated the plant '35, '36 into the spring of '37 and uh -
5398.03|5421.83|The next time he come back a couple weeks later he said, "I can't give you that job." He said, "The diesel superintendent's son-in-law is a contractor and he's been out of work for three years. He wants to give it to him, but he said, 'You can work on the job; you'll be his foreman while he's here." Well, I went out -
5422.58|5425.55|I didn't do a hell of a lot of work.
5425.57|5428.73|He had a crew of about 12 men, bossing around.
5429.77|5433.83|He wasn't much of an operator, I found that out.
5433.85|5434.69|When we got that -
5435.84|5443.1|Oh yeah, in the meantime, this fellow that I took the plant over from had gone up to Dauphin, Manitoba.
5443.86|5446.36|He got a job running a steam plant up there.
5446.39|5451.73|While he was there, he found out there was a little town, Winnipegosis Manitoba that needed a power plant.
5452.52|5459.41|And he right away makes a deal with them to put in power, and he didn't have any money.
5459.89|5461.09|So he comes hollering to me.
5461.33|5463.23|He said, "Can you help me out?"
5463.25|5464.19|He said, "I'm in trouble.
5464.21|5466.48|I have a franchise here, that can't fulfill it."
5467.04|5468.72|Well, hell, I didn't have any money.
5468.76|5478.73|So I phoned down to the super - not the super - the general manager of the Dominion Electric, told him the story, and "Oh," he said, "Well, we'll pull him out."
5479.86|5481.5|So they go up and take a look at it.
5481.56|5484.95|They take over the franchise.
5484.97|5488.03|And then they said, "We're going to put you up there.
5488.05|5490.76|There's no wiring in the town.
5490.8|5492.44|There isn't a power of any kind in the town.
5492.46|5497.29|There's about 120 places to wire up and put you up there to wire up the town."
5497.31|5499.35|Not to build the power lines.
5499.37|5502.18|This son-in-law deal, he was going to build the power lines.
5502.68|5504.74|But I was going to wire the buildings.
5504.76|5506.1|So I went up there in June.
5507.33|5510.34|And my brother Mac followed me up in about two weeks.
5510.35|5513.6|Everything was closed down in Tompkins.
5513.62|5517.95|And they were moving that plant up to Winnipegosis.
5517.97|5519.57|Well, I had nothing to do with the plant.
5519.59|5521.77|All I did was wire the stores and houses.
5522.98|5527.36|My brother Mac and I worked up there. In the month of September,
5527.66|5531.05|they needed me down at Estevan for a month.
5531.07|5534.53|My brother, Mac had a helper and kept wiring.
5534.55|5540.64|I went down to Estevan for distribution, the mines and everything, for a month.
5541.0|5553.35|While that guy went out and looked over another job, he was going into a different field, and the guy that's the operator down there.
5553.37|5556.9|So then I come back up to Winnipegosis, and I wound up there on Armistice Day.
5557.41|5560.62|And I walked out of the - out of there with everything cut and dried.
5561.42|5572.8|I had a little box full of material left, and I sent it back to the wholesaler at Winnipeg, and they paid me back 75% on the dollar, what it was worth.
5572.82|5586.04|I walked out with $1,200 in my pocket after living all summer and buying a second-handed V8 Ford, which turned out to be a kind of a lemon after a while.
5586.66|5594.57|Well, when I went back to Estevan, I was back to Estevan by the end of, well, the middle of November.
5594.61|5610.55|Then I took over the distribution, operating, servicing all the mines and the town of Estevan.
5610.67|5612.23|That was in the fall of '37.
5612.7|5621.23|In the spring of '38, I went out and relieved out at Gravelbourg in Lafleche while they changed operators out there.
5621.25|5629.6|And in the fall of '38, I was sent out to Shaunavon and Gravelbourg to calibrate meters.
5632.61|5637.6|Ohy, I got about two weeks on that and then come back to Estevan again.
5637.62|5640.88|And then I kept on working in Estevan until
5641.89|5642.73|I was married.
5643.15|5646.86|Oh, yeah, the war broke out in the fall of '39.
5646.88|5653.97|And they were building an airport in Estevan, around '42, and ... one hell of a place to work.
5657.71|5659.92|And I worked there '38, '39.
5660.6|5662.1|Fall of '40, we were married.
5663.46|5671.61|And there's '41, '42, '43, '44, on call, 24 hours a day, 30 days a month.
5672.77|5677.66|But when I got holidays - I don't think I took holidays off.
5677.68|5680.59|You know, maybe take off the out day to go hunting.
5680.6|5681.47|And that was all.
5682.97|5691.98|And then in - to get back to the story again, by this time, Dominion Electric were getting pretty big up in the Peace River country.
5692.02|5694.99|The superintendent was spending a lot of time up there.
5695.01|5699.15|So I pretty well had charge of everything in Estevan - distribution.
5699.67|5706.14|And they blew up a big generator down at the power plant.
5706.16|5707.44|And they tore it all apart.
5708.08|5713.77|Got it opened up so you could see what had burned out on the wiring end of it.
5713.79|5725.07|And Schlosser, the general manager, he didn't know how to put that into words to send a telegram to New York to tell them what had happened and what was necessary.
5725.09|5727.23|So he asked me to go down and take a look at it.
5728.66|5736.35|And then we went back up to the office and drafted a telegram to New York to tell them what was involved in that.
5736.38|5739.46|It was going to be a lengthy lay - shutdown.
5741.04|5756.39|And then after we had sent the telegram, this was about 9 o'clock at night, we were sitting in the office, and I said, "I see where the Power Corporation, or the Power Commission at that time, are advertising for a bunch of line they're going to build.
5756.41|5757.39|In fact, they're building
5758.16|5768.87|tearing down airport lines at Midale and Halbrite, all in through there, and building up into power lines in those small towns."
5768.89|5772.14|I said, "I got a damn good notion to bid on that."
5772.16|5776.98|I said, "I know how to build power lines if anybody does."
5777.0|5778.06|He said, "Why don't you?"
5778.36|5780.77|He said, "I'll give you a leave of absence.
5780.91|5784.15|If you don't get any work", he said, "you can come back to work with me."
5784.86|5801.99|Well, I went and looked the jobs over, came into Regina, ...
5797.2|5797.93|Contracts.
5800|5805.03|And, two days later they were opened.
5805.05|5814.22|There were four bidders, and they were all older men that had been contracting power lines when the Depression came. It was at
5814.37|5816.37|'28, '29, and '30.
5818.36|5827.31|And now, 15 years later, they're still sitting there with all their tools and equipment, and nothing had happened for 15 years, you might say.
5828.83|5831.49|And these guys were all in there, bidding, and I'm in their bidding.
5831.55|5832.39|I'm the kid bidder.
5832.91|5836.46|These fellas are all 15, 20 years older than I am.
5838.08|5842.72|Well, they opened up the tenders, and it was one of the most amazing things that you ever saw.
5844.1|5873.32|The tenders ranged - now this is in 1945 dollars. You can multiply that by five for today. The first tender opened up, $11,000; the next one, $11,500; the next one, $11,075, and then mine was the last one, $10,050. Well here I was just
5873.72|5875.08|right in the ballpark.
5876.66|5882.17|Those guys, I'll bet you any money that they went to that graves thinking that I had an inside tip-off.
5883.35|5888.6|But the amazing part of it was that we all bid it in such close range, and it was really a complicated job.
5888.62|5897.52|You had to take up thousands and thousands of feet of underground cable that was buried two feet under the ground, and you were supposed to take it up without damaging it,
5898.09|5927.17|and, tearing down all these old power lines, and there's telephones and power and everything mixed up. And then, using that same material or what was usable, build a power line - well in one case, from Macoun to Halbrite. And we were all bidding that close. It was almost impossible to think that four men could sit down individually and come up within a thousand dollars from top to bottom. Anyway,
5928.65|5929.43|away I go.
5930.47|5935.56|Then a little later, they bid on a line from Stoughton to Estevan.
5935.58|5940.76|This was the first high voltage, suspension-type line in the province.
5940.78|5942.63|None of us had ever bid on it.
5942.65|5949.82|And only the one guy, that was this son-in-law, again, as I referred to him to,
5949.84|5951.96|and myself was the only two bidders.
5951.98|5955.58|And he bid $600 a mile, and I bid $550.
5956.43|5962.52|Today, you pay about $3,000 a mile for that same kind of a line.
5962.54|5963.46|Anyway, I got it.
5963.8|5966.36|Now I'm in business.
5966.38|5969.97|That line wasn't to be started until the next year.
5971.43|5971.91|Well, I worked -
5972.39|5976.76|I tore down the airports, and I got the line going from Halbrite to Midale,
5977.89|5980.43|and then part of it to Macoun.
5980.45|5982.92|Well, then again, I started hiring.
5984.08|5986.22|I was paying another guy to wire,
5986.82|5989.41|and I kept him going all winter in Midale.
5989.43|5992.77|I went to Estevan and really didn't do much of anything.
5992.79|5995.8|Sort of laid around all winter,
5995.82|5998.74|and getting ready for the next spring.
5998.76|6004.35|And then the next spring is when I had to wrestle some equipment and get going on my own.
6004.37|6006.83|That fall, I hired -
6008.15|6012.09|No, I went and I bought a half-ton truck. Thats ... Bought an old
6014.46|6021.27|half-ton six, seven years old, and had been on a cream route. Pretty well done in, but it served my purpose.
6021.29|6026.07|When I need the heavier truck, I rent it. Rented a man with a truck.
6026.09|6034.05|So then I - oh yeah, that fall, that's right, there's some army trucks came for sale up in Regina.
6034.07|6035.49|And I come up and I bought a,
6036.46|6043.53|what they call a 1500 weight, that's about two tons, and a gun carrier.
6043.55|6045.66|That was a useful thing.
6045.68|6046.68|Four-wheel drive.
6047.48|6049.92|You could go anyplace with it.
6049.94|6051.86|I put a boom on it for setting poles.
6053.25|6055.27|And then the next spring I bought another truck.
6055.75|6059.19|In fact, I bought two trucks the next spring.
6059.21|6061.82|But then I started and got going.
6061.84|6063.5|And, uh...
6064.63|6066.39|Oh, yeah, I forgot.
6066.41|6070.93|The Fall of '45, when I finished the airport, I came into Regina here and did some work.
6071.05|6079.48|They were starting up a new building development, the first one in Regina for 20 years, I guess, and this was for returned soldiers.
6079.5|6087.93|And after I put the distribution system in there, that was in December and January, and then in February I went up to Saskatoon, they had the same thing up there.
6087.95|6094.38|And I went up and did that one, and then I was getting into it towards spring, and
6094.72|6102.35|Then the old Dominion Electric had some work to do at Craik and Davidson, so I went down there and I worked there until the spring break up.
6103.83|6106.35|And then I went back to Estevan.
6106.85|6109.56|I was still living in Estevan at this time.
6109.58|6114.12|Went back to Estevan and started on my power line job, on my contract.
6115.51|6118.53|And really never looked back from that day on.
6118.55|6119.33|It was work.
6119.35|6120.65|There was always work ahead.
6120.67|6122.31|I was never out of work.
6122.33|6125.73|Well, you'd lay off in the wintertime.
6125.75|6137.68|Lay off Christmas until maybe March or April and then start up small by the time the snow was all gone and the fields were dry.
6137.7|6143.79|You would build up your full crew and get going.
6143.85|6145.51|So it was an interesting
6146.3|6175.28|part of the contracting with that start start up period. I started out with men - I didn't have a man that knew anything about line work, and I finally got a hold of a alignment a little fella he went about five foot six, but a hell of a good lineman. Hard worker, but he could hardly write his own name. He could read enough to get by. And then I - the next thing I -
6176.83|6179.47|In about a month's time, I picked up Art Miller.
6179.57|6186.46|Art came, he was sent to me by - he had come to the power here to get work, and they didn't need men, they sent him to me.
6186.48|6197.3|And he had climbed some telephone poles in his day, but he wasn't much, you couldn't rate him as a lineman, but he was real good with trucks.
6197.32|6204.47|He had been a driver in the Army, so I had a good man to move our trucks and to look after them and see that they were running.
6205.62|6209.49|And then from there on, you hire nothing but kids.
6209.55|6211.1|You know, young guys, 18 years old.
6211.8|6214.91|They knew nothing from nothing, and you train them.
6214.93|6217.6|But I saw that these young guys, at that time you could
6218.51|6226.48|give them a kick in the rear end if they need and pat them on the shoulder the next half hour and tell them what a good job they were doing.
6226.5|6228.32|And they worked for you, I'll tell you that.
6228.34|6236.17|I've turned out a lot of good men and they come back to me after, "Oh you were tough, but you sure taught us a lot while we worked for you." And,
6237.07|6240.07|it's one of those things that you just keep going.
6241.89|6247.34|That was one of the biggest thrills, was going out with a bunch of young guys and training them.
6248.5|6254.47|And as your crew got bigger and you couldn't be out with them all the time, I always missed that.
6254.57|6257.93|I always loved working with a bunch of men.
6257.95|6262.72|And I knew how to get work out of them.
6262.92|6268.92|Once in a while you'd have a guy that's a failure and wouldn't come up to standard.
6268.94|6270.05|You'd have to let him go.
6271.71|6274.83|There was an awful lot of shovel work in those days.
6274.95|6277.15|You'd break a guy in and get him hardened in.
6277.76|6286.97|You hire a guy, come out, never done any work in his life, and give him a shovel and start telling him to dig an anchor hole, and he thinks it's an impossibility.
6286.99|6292.92|And you spend an hour with him and show him how to use the tools, and in a couple of days you've got a good man.
6292.94|6299.31|He hardens in fast, he gets tired but if he sits down for five minutes, he's up and going again.
6299.33|6300.61|And that's just about...
6302.21|6305.62|a lost art today, there is no more shovel work.
6305.64|6311.05|You hire a guy today and you've got to put him on a big machine.
6311.07|6314.45|You're almost afraid to him maneuver
6314.45|6318.95|in case he smashes it up or there's something wrong.
6318.95|6324.81|We're talking now the end of 1945 and 1946, the '46 -
6325.97|6327.19|'46, yes.
6327.31|6330.19|I built that big line to Stoughton in '46.
6331.42|6339.67|Besides doing many odd jobs, I built the lines out of Regina down to the new radio stations six, eight miles south.
6341.07|6347.4|And I did some work for the city at that time.
6347.42|6352.96|And I finished that line on the 9th of December, that big line.
6353.04|6354.53|That was an experience.
6354.99|6356.76|And I had to do everything on my own.
6356.78|6359.72|You had no place to go to ask for information.
6359.74|6366.01|You had to rig up all your own equipment and everything.
6366.03|6369.69|But we'd come out of it, made some money on it.
6369.79|6375.16|All my diggers, they went on the strike when they were about a third of the way up that line.
6375.18|6376.84|They kept asking for more money.
6377.06|6378.66|They wanted peace work.
6379.44|6380.77|They kept asking for more money.
6381.12|6388.29|One day I heard there was a boring machine in Winnipeg and I jumped on the train and I went in and I bought a brand new boring machine.
6388.39|6391.67|It was the second one to come into Saskatchewan.
6391.69|6398.0|And then from there on I had the diggers behind the ball and we could dig all the holes we needed with that one machine.
6399.36|6405.63|And we finished that job, yeah, on the 9th of December.
6405.65|6406.57|I remember that so well.
6406.59|6409.37|And then I laid  up - for the winter.
6409.39|6410.97|Didn't do anything all winter
6411.8|6413.22|until the next spring.
6415.2|6418.94|And then we had to tender about early April we tentered.
6419.81|6424.03|I got some work building a line from Weyburn to Radville.
6424.05|6425.37|That's about 30 miles.
6427.51|6429.51|We start on that - that was early spring
6429.53|6430.52|we start on that.
6430.53|6435.12|When we finish that, we did some farms around Weyburn.
6436.0|6439.32|That was in fourty - '46...
6441.85|6445.66|No, that was '47, that's right, '47.
6445.76|6454.15|And after that, I got a job up at, a big job up at the Rosetown area.
6454.17|6459.32|I got a hundred and some miles with eight or ten towns to build out.
6459.34|6463.1|That was the summer's work.
6463.12|6469.51|And I built up a crew and got them going, and then the power come along, they want me to go up to Yorkton area.
6470.45|6477.64|There were six towns up there and about 50 miles of line to build.
6477.8|6481.29|And that was really stretching myself a bit when I took that on.
6481.31|6492.2|I had to leave my crew at Rosetown and go over and start up another crew out of the blue at Yorkton.
6492.22|6494.53|And that was going through bush country.
6494.73|6495.94|That was a new experience for us.
6498.07|6507.82|I had to cut the swath through the bush where you're going to build the line.
6507.84|6512.93|You had to cut a 25-foot swath through these trees.
6512.94|6514.97|And they were trees up to 40 feet high.
6516.43|6518.71|Well, you could get a lot of labor up in that country.
6518.75|6520.17|Put guys in there with axes.
6520.21|6521.23|Get a good ax man.
6521.32|6523.18|It was amazing what he could do in a day.
6524.32|6530.05|And not only chop them down, but you had to pile them up neatly and everything.
6530.07|6531.31|One of the biggest things that
6531.46|6538.89|And that job was bidding, I don't know how to bid, how do you estimate what it's going to cost to ...
6538.91|6549.34|However, I let Art Miller and the crew back at Rosetown, and I stuck with this job up there.
6549.36|6551.84|By Christmas time, I had her finished.
6551.86|6556.79|On the 23rd of December, I came home. When I finally got out of ...
6557.7|6559.34|where we were headquartered,
6559.42|6562.34|it was about 11 o'clock at night, and I drove home.
6562.42|6565.07|I got home about 3 o'clock in the morning.
6565.09|6568.03|It was wintertime, and the heater in my car quit.
6568.55|6572.69|I thought I'd freeze my feet before I got home.
6572.71|6574.9|And right now, I'm going to pause for a moment.
6578.84|6586.07|I had to go get something to wet my throat, sitting here talking for a half hour without any let-up.
6586.81|6594.88|And as the funny says - Fools Hesitate, Funny McGee. Well, that was the end of 1947.
6595.18|6604.85|The spring of 1948, I could see then things were going to move ahead, and I had to make some definite moves.
6604.91|6607.29|So I decided to move to Regina.
6607.31|6612.38|Phyllis, and I come up to Regina, and we looked around for a couple of days and found a house
6614.16|6641.3|and moved up here. It was still spring there was a lot of snow I think we come up about - maybe about the end of march or the middle of april sometime in there we moved to Regina. Now, I didn't have any work for '48 we had to tender. Well I still had a little work to finish up at Rosetown and a little
6641.57|6644.67|to finish up at Yorkton from the fall of '47.
6645.67|6646.99|Odds and ends to do. So,
6647.81|6653.54|I was able to keep my - as soon as spring broke, I got my key men up there and finished that.
6654.0|6657.54|And then of course the old tendering went in again, about the end of April.
6660.02|6674|And I have to really think hard now to think of where I worked in '48. In '48...
6675.43|6684.43|I did a job from Vanguard to Aneroid, rebuilt a substation in there.
6687.75|6688.91|Now I'll have to pause.
6692.26|6693.76|Yes, now it comes to me.
6694.04|6700.99|I did an awful lot of work south of Swift Current in the Mennonite areas.
6701.19|6703.61|There's all Mennonite farms around there.
6705.01|6714.92|And we did, we must have worked in there until well after - oh yeah, it was well after harvest.
6714.94|6717.23|It was in the fall by the time we finished up there.
6717.65|6718.97|Then I come to the city.
6719.41|6728.44|By this time the city is expanding and I set up a whole big area of poles in the city here.
6730.24|6739.05|That was the start of our work in the city which, by the way, carried on for 10 years that I had men working in the city here the year-round.
6739.05|6758.99|Not a big crew. A crew about six men. mostly. Five, six men, boring machine, pole truck, and another two-ton truck. Everything was paid for by the hour. It was sort of a meal ticket as far as I was concerned because
6759.4|6765.37|It was right in the city here, and I could - well, they supervised it.
6765.39|6766.86|I didn't have to supervise it.
6767.66|6771.74|All I had to do was send in the bill every two weeks.
6773.85|6777.97|And I had steady rental for my equipment.
6777.99|6779.48|I didn't make much on payroll.
6779.49|6781.08|I made 10% on payroll.
6781.38|6783.72|We had a set rate for equipment.
6783.82|6785.73|And, incidentally, you talk about inflation.
6786.27|6787.39|In the 10 years
6788.58|6793.29|I never raised the rental on my equipment.
6793.31|6796.61|I was happy with what I was getting, and I wasn't greedy.
6797.77|6806.08|And naturally, the city was happy, and it was - everybody was happy with the arrangement.
6806.1|6816.7|And it was all made over a telephone call between the city Light and Power Superintendent, whom I had known for some years, and myself.
6817.51|6823.19|And he asked me what I wanted, and I told him, he said, "Send me a letter outlining what you said just now."
6824.09|6832.04|And I did that, and about eight years later, he said, "Hey, Lindy," he said, "What kind of a deal did you and I make over the phone that day?"
6832.1|6836.52|And I told him, he said, "Have you got a copy of the letter you owed me?"
6836.54|6838.41|He said, "I can't find anything in here."
6838.51|6840.85|I said, "Yes, I have, and I'll dig it up."
6840.87|6842.27|He said, "Send me a copy."
6842.29|6845.49|He said, "There's been some inquiries around here about that."
6845.51|6846.31|And he said, "I...
6846.43|6851.86|I want to have the answers." But that's the kind of working relationship we had.
6853.44|6859.51|And I want to go back now to 1947, when I was running the two crews.
6860.35|6867.58|I had about 60 men working for me on the two areas.
6867.6|6871.95|There was one time that I didn't get home for six weeks.
6871.97|6873.55|Phyllis was in Regina here
6874.02|6874.8|with the kids.
6875.08|6884.3|We had, at that time, four, maybe five, maybe Janie was a baby by that time.
6884.32|6888.02|And I had, she said, "Can't you come?"
6888.08|6889.24|I said, "I can't leave!
6889.32|6893.89|I've got so darn much out here, so much to look after, I just can't leave."
6894.03|6896.71|I was working seven days a week.
6896.73|6902.32|And about, well, from six in the morning until about ten at night, I was on the go every day.
6904.23|6907.51|The only time you got a little spell off is if it rained, that
6907.57|6908.65|you had to stay inside.
6908.67|6910.71|And then I'd try to catch up on my book work.
6912.15|6917.28|And I was making, writing out payrolls out in the country.
6917.96|6921.72|I had a bookkeeper in town here, but it was unbelievable.
6922.2|6923.47|And then I to invoice.
6923.52|6924.41|I had to invoice.
6924.47|6928.37|I'd send that in to the bookkeeper and tell him to invoice it.
6928.39|6932.71|To keep the cash flow right, you had to keep on going.
6934.58|6939.75|It was a hectic time, I want to tell you.
6939.77|6943.69|But it was one of those things that went with the job.
6943.71|6944.59|I enjoyed it.
6944.61|6949.74|It was hard on Phyllis, but she got by some way or other.
6949.76|6950.56|Well, that was '48.
6950.64|6952.48|Now I got back, I covered '48.
6952.56|6955.94|Yeah, we finished up in the city here that fall.
6955.96|6956.39|'49.
6958.65|6964.15|We started out in the... in the...
6965.11|6968.14|near Yorkton, up in the northeast again.
6968.16|6978.95|We got an early job there, and I more or less left Art Miller in charge of it.
6979.59|6985.32|Only a small job, about 30 miles - 25 miles of line, I guess.
6985.34|6992.77|And after it was built, the head superintendent came out there to look at it, and he and I drove over.
6993.68|6994.7|Never said a word.
6994.82|7003.31|Drove the full length of the line, and when we got over there to the end of it, I said, "Well, what did you see wrong?"
7005.41|7006.77|He said, "This one thing."
7008.42|7013.92|He named one thing that he saw wrong.
7013.94|7015.99|I said, "If that's all you saw wrong.
7016.01|7016.65|I'm glad."
7017.01|7020.55|I said, "That line looks like a rank amateur built it."
7020.83|7022.25|Well, he said, "What did you see wrong?"
7022.3|7032.51|"Oh, cripes," I said, "I could name a dozen things that I spotted driving across there that wasn't right the way I - it would have been if I was there."
7033.13|7034.69|"Well," he said, "I didn't see it."
7034.73|7037.26|"Well, it wasn't serious," I said, "but it wasn't right."
7038.7|7042.04|Well, anyway, that was the start of '49. Now I have -
7043.01|7049.79|Oh, yeah, then we got the job building another chunk of the high-tension line from Estevan
7049.99|7052.06|that would extend right through to Yorkton.
7052.07|7056.12|We got the piece from south of Melville up to Yorkton.
7056.14|7060.95|That was another about 50 miles of high-tension line.
7061.05|7063.67|Well, you didn't build that so fast, you know.
7063.75|7071.12|I worked - I worked on that right through until we got snowbound in December.
7071.24|7075.01|It stormed so much that we just couldn't move anymore.
7075.07|7076.37|We plowed out -
7077.31|7083.18|rigged up a snow plow, and the plow road opened one day, and the next day it was filled in again.
7084.28|7086.38|So finally I talked to the superintendent.
7086.4|7089.51|"Well," he said, "Basically, we're not ready for that line until next spring."
7090.55|7092.05|He said, "You better shut her down."
7092.27|7095.03|So I shut her down for the winter.
7095.05|7099.1|That was the winter of, yeah, '49.
7099.19|7100.95|And in '50, we started out again - 
7100.95|7114.68|- the last time. This machine may not erase as you go along, as my old one did. I could just play over the tape and it would erase what was on previously - 
7114.68|7120.68|...outside of Yorkton. Then moved down to Shaunavon - 
7132.47|7160.02|...Alberta about the end of harvest and we worked up there. We did some highline move where they're building a high - it was up at the Vermilion and Lloydminster area, They were moving a highway - or widening a highway, and we moved some line for that. And then we put in a - a section of farm land - farm line there, about 50 miles of farm line.
7160.54|7168.26|And we were on that until about Christmas time when we wound up and then moved back into town here.
7170.19|7190.53|Then while we were here, the city had a bunch of line they wanted built and we worked on it through the winter with a - oh, a sizable force and set all several hundred poles for them. That was the -
7194.2|7198.87|Yeah, the windup of '49 and into the spring of '50.
7199.79|7208.98|Then in '50, as I started on that, I said - yes -
7209.6|7218.76|We built the piece out of Yorkton and then down to Shaunavon and then back up where?
7218.78|7219.82|I have to pause.
7220.53|7229.76|Oh, yes, we'd come back up and build a line from Montmartre to Kipling, which was about 50 or 60 miles, and built two or three towns along with that.
7230.6|7232.22|That pretty well wound up our season.
7232.24|7233.72|We had a real good year.
7234.86|7242.13|And then one of the other contractors was behind, and the superintendent come along and he said, "I want you to go and take some of his line."
7242.19|7243.41|And I said, "I don't want to.
7243.43|7244.15|I'm finished.
7244.51|7245.49|I've had a good year."
7246.31|7250.28|I said, "I don't want to go taking something away from him and create an enemy."
7250.9|7262.06|And at that, he took me down with him, showed me, oh, it was about 100 miles out of Regina, showed me what he wanted done.
7262.14|7279.54|And he went into the, this guy was running a camp, a small camp, and he went into his caboose where he was working, and he stayed there for three hours, trying to sell him that he couldn't handle that work and it had to be done before Christmas.
7280.45|7283.71|And he wanted to give it over to me, and I sat out in the car all that while.
7283.77|7286.23|I didn't know if they had killed each other in there or what.
7286.43|7288.36|I stayed in the car, and he finally came out.
7289.56|7292.78|And he said, "I couldn't convince the old man that you were going to do it anyway." he said.
7292.8|7294.42|I said, "I don't want to do it."
7295.2|7298.57|He said, "I'm commissioning you to do it."
7298.59|7299.91|He said, "and that's all there is to it.
7299.95|7300.81|You're going to go and do it."
7302.07|7305.67|So I sort of had to get back into gear again and go out and do this work.
7305.91|7306.99|And the weather stayed good.
7307.5|7308.62|Then on top of that, the -
7309.34|7320.81|another project came up just outside of Regina, and a bunch of farms just south of Regina here, and we went out and did those.
7320.83|7337.27|And that wound her up to '50 - '51. We went up north in the Rosetown area and we had a big job up there, a lot of three-phase transmission line and about probably
7338.45|7343.25|60 or 70 farms to do.
7343.27|7366.26|And then down in the Ogema - Shaunavon area, yeah, Fife Lake, and in that area we did a bunch of towns there in '50, '51, we were in the Ogema–Bengough, and in through there we did 60 or 70 miles of line in a bunch of towns.
7368.23|7371.3|Again, working about 30, 40 men all the time.
7371.32|7373.88|And then just about then, yeah.
7374.82|7377.32|Then in '52, the farms started coming in.
7377.38|7383.89|Then we really swung into the farm building in '52, '53.
7383.99|7386.2|And, we geared up.
7386.22|7388.64|We were building five miles of line every day.
7388.9|7395.39|That was the pace we were hitting in '53, '54, '55
7396.16|7397.32|kept up that pace,
7397.36|7399.28|'56, we did more than ever.
7399.3|7403.71|I think we did about 600 farms in '56.
7403.75|7409.94|Then that was pretty well getting near the end of it, of the farm phase.
7409.96|7416.6|But all this while, don't forget, I still had a crew working in the city.
7416.66|7421.47|And sometimes, you know, four or five men sometimes we'd have to boost that up.
7421.53|7425.48|We'd get - They'd have some extra work and we'd have to boost up and get
7425.71|7429.25|eight or ten men working. So -
7432.84|7435.1|Oh, I didn't relate in '53.
7435.42|7439.8|Yes, I incorporated in 1953.
7440.96|7443.55|Before that, I was just L. H. Achen.
7443.57|7445.59|In 1953, I incorporated.
7445.63|7455.38|I'd been going eight years then, and my insurance man said I should be incorporated in case something happens - something disastrous happens,
7456.34|7457.56|you better be incorporated.
7457.58|7462.72|So I incorporated, and that year I bought property on Ottawa Street and built a shop.
7466.15|7477.78|And from there on, it seemed most of my work was sitting behind a desk, and that more or less took all the joy out of it.
7477.8|7485.38|We were out building all these lines in from - starting about '52 is when the farm program really started.
7486.21|7499.4|And we were punching through, I think, at '52, about 350 farms, and then we jumped up to 500 or better every year for '53, '54, '55, '56.
7500.28|7502.82|Then in '57, it started tapering down.
7504.26|7507.26|In '58, tapered down some more.
7508.36|7516.11|More guys were getting into it, and the government were encouraging more to get into it because it cheapened the price.
7516.55|7521.71|Guys were going in, bidding, and one year and they'd be out of it.
7521.75|7522.75|They'd be on their fanny.
7523.83|7532.38|And the head superintendent seemed to think that that's the only way he could get it done cheap.
7532.68|7534.14|We never raised our prices.
7534.21|7542.77|We got so much a pole, so much an anchor, so much a transformer, from 1952 through to 1957.
7544.75|7546.33|And then they opened 'er wide up.
7546.65|7550.29|They said, "We're going to start tendering everything."
7550.97|7556.22|The bigger contractors, those that could build, there were just two of us, could build 500 farms a year.
7556.84|7566.47|We are set on that price of $13 a pole, $10 an anchor, and $30 a transformer.
7567.19|7568.39|Get out and go to it.
7568.41|7569.93|Do all you could.
7569.95|7573.23|When they opened their wide up in '58,
7574.87|7580.03|Well, then these little one-horse guys, they come in there, and they started bidding $8, $10 a pole.
7580.47|7582.73|'58, I never got any work.
7582.75|7584.78|Just sat there; was outbid.
7584.8|7588.8|I said, "No, I won't bid below what it cost me to do it with a profit."
7589.46|7594.22|And so when the work was all let out, I was sitting there, I didn't have any work.
7594.49|7598.66|I said, "Well, we'll see how many fellows know Lindy Achen." I said.
7599.51|7602.61|In the meantime, I forgot to mention, this is when we started doing
7603.01|7606.24|foundation piling in the city here.
7607.58|7610.71|And that was just a sort of a sideline that we were doing.
7611.35|7615.88|When we'd get short on work, we'd go out and bid on -
7616.98|7618.56|there's a plane coming over -
7626.1|7628.98|We'd bid on foundation jobs, enough -
7629.45|7630.65|You never made much on them.
7630.71|7634.89|It was very tough bidding, but you kept your crew working, kept everybody busy.
7634.91|7635.64|That was a big thing.
7636.06|7639.8|Well, in the meantime, I hadn't gone through all the mechanics of this thing.
7640.56|7645.25|I'd gone from one boring machine up to five boring machines.
7646.39|7652.88|When we were building 500 farms a year, we had to have
7653.66|7657.32|two machines going steady in the country and sometimes three.
7658.66|7664.65|And we also always had to have a machine in town here to take care of the city work.
7664.67|7671.59|And then we developed a machine that could go down 30 feet for foundation boring.
7671.61|7676.24|So by this time, I pretty well had to keep one man in the shop all the time.
7677.4|7683.11|Well, after '57, I kept Art Miller in the shop to more or less
7683.64|7688.59|look after the guys out in the country to keep their equipment going and everything.
7689.29|7692.46|And he didn't go out and run any crews or anything.
7692.48|7698.89|He just stayed in the shop and kept things rolling.
7698.91|7704.44|And this was all very interesting, you know, to see the thing grow.
7706.2|7710.43|In '55, when I had my heart attack, you know, I was right out of it.
7710.9|7714.44|I could go down and sign checks, and that was about it.
7715.34|7722.77|Thank goodness I had Art trained well enough at that time that he could keep everything under control.
7722.85|7735.74|And while he'd always come to me to ask me what should I do, what should I do, I'd have a hard time convincing him, well, do what you think, or else give him an answer of what he should do.
7735.76|7738.84|That was all part of the business that I went through.
7738.99|7741.66|And I wasn't - In '55 and '56
7741.88|7745.54|I was sort of hanging on the ropes, and those were big years.
7747.24|7752.79|That's when we turned out some of our best production.
7752.81|7757.71|Well, anyway, to get back to '58, when I was bid right out, didn't have any work.
7757.97|7760.03|See how many guys know Linda Achen?
7760.05|7763.64|Well, as it was, I kept all my key men working.
7764.0|7768.44|One job would come, and another little job would come, and a lot of...
7769.1|7778.23|work would come where i'd have to go and do the layout work. Plants starting up and everything you had to go out lay out a substation for them, or a small distribution system.
7778.23|7795.27|The potash out at Kalium between here and Moose Jaw start up and we did all their distribution layout for - not only did the engineering as well as building the lines. And uh that lasted for I guess it's still going today. That
7795.68|7799.48|started about 1956 or 7, about '57.
7800.22|7805.67|And I think our outfit still does all their expansion work, which is an ongoing thing.
7805.71|7806.65|It never stops.
7807.65|7809.39|They keep expanding all the time.
7812.0|7814.4|And I'm still talking back in '58.
7814.48|7822.11|Yeah, when the dust was settled in '58, well, I had my men, most of them were in Regina here.
7822.13|7823.71|We didn't have any country work, but
7824.04|7826.95|the jobs kept showing up and showing up here and there.
7827.81|7829.01|Keep busy all the time.
7829.05|7830.83|They were overhauling equipment.
7830.85|7832.88|We had everything in first-class shape.
7834.84|7841.55|And that fall, when the dust settled, I was taking my full salary, and everything else was paid up.
7841.57|7843.23|We didn't skimp on anything.
7845.12|7849.38|And when the season was finished, what did we have?
7849.4|7851.05|$8,000 profits.
7852.66|7861.96|And I gave Art $3,000, and I gave Bill, second in command $2,000, and I kept $3,000 for the company.
7862.36|7865.5|And I said, "Now we'll see what happens next year."
7867.1|7875.3|And the next year, in '59, things started picking up again.
7877.6|7881.94|And we kept going, '59 -
7883.65|7893.17|I'd have to think hard now to go back to... Oh, by that time, yeah, potash mines were coming in, and we were doing the distributions for them.
7893.39|7899.68|That was - those were big jobs, and we had to do the design and supply the material and everything.
7900.12|7906.27|So you got a chance to roll over some dollars and make a few cents on every dollar you rolled over.
7908.19|7909.01|And that went on.
7909.61|7912.89|Then in '60, '61,
7913.36|7916.29|'62, work started showing up again.
7917.93|7919.85|Bidding was tough.
7920.15|7922.41|You had to "pee in there sharp" to get a job.
7924.11|7926.33|But we got some good jobs and made some money.
7928.92|7932.44|And when was my last year?
7932.46|7933.6|'65, yeah.
7933.62|7938.04|'65, I got a real good job at Swift Current.
7938.06|7940.23|One of the biggest jobs I ever bid.
7940.33|7942.19|It was $190,000,
7942.42|7950.37|in one particular project, and should have really made some money on it.
7950.39|7956.68|And by God, it rained and rained and rained that summer down in Swift Current, where it never rains.
7958.75|7965.03|And we kept on losing time, falling behind. Go out -
7965.46|7968.52|Well, when you get a rain, you lose a day.
7968.58|7970.94|We had to keep the men, a crew of 30 men,
7971.72|7981.53|costing us $18 a day just for the camping outfit that we had in there, and we supplied the camp.
7981.55|7983.95|They fed them for $18 a day.
7983.97|7989.14|And, we had a supply a minimum of 18 men a day.
7989.16|7997.69|Well, when the dust was all settled, and that winter I said to Art, I said, "Okay, go over the books now, charge up that job, and tell me exactly what we made on it."
7998.7|8007.13|When he charged out everything, overhead and everything that goes against the job, we had made 6%, which was about as low as you can get.
8007.57|8012.75|I mean, that's kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel.
8012.77|8018.22|And that was my last year.
8018.26|8020.36|Then that was the end of the year.
8020.4|8025.69|Well, previous to that, I told them that I was getting out, that they had to take over
8026.34|8031.01|at the end of the year, or I'd put the outfit on the block and sell it.
8031.03|8032.19|We'll go into that now.
8032.21|8034.45|I'm going to take a rest.
8034.47|8041.03|I'm into my... Well, not so bad.
8041.09|8046.22|I've only talked about an hour and fifteen minutes so far, and I've gotten fairly condensed.
8046.84|8053.87|I had this stretched out originally to about three hours, but there was a lot of...
8055.26|8060.81|shall we say, incidentals in there that didn't mean anything.
8060.83|8063.41|So I'll cut off for now, and it's five o'clock right now.
8067.94|8068.7|Here we are again.
8068.74|8070.16|This is September the 16th.
8071.08|8083.87|I'll try and wind this - fill this tape out by reminiscing over some of the things that happened throughout the years of my contracting,
8084.91|8090.54|and maybe even back up to the years when I was working for a power company.
8090.58|8104.76|So every once in a while it may be a bit repetitious, but accept it for what it is.
8104.76|8111.02|I set up - I set up the -
8113.5|8116.2|the terms under which I wanted to sell the business to the men.
8118.39|8121.01|And I was not for selling to a partnership.
8121.03|8130.64|It had to be a company, and Art Miller was to be at the head of it, which meant he had to own fifty-one percent of the shares.
8130.66|8142.41|And there were Bill Zaharachuk, Von Kennedy, and George Jenny were coming in as minority partners.
8144.4|8149.56|And we all agreed to that.
8149.6|8152.51|They were all willing to just take a chunk.
8152.53|8156.45|They all knew Art and knew that he knew how to run the business, etc.
8157.65|8162.12|So they went ahead on that basis, and everything was going fine.
8162.6|8166.2|Things never looked any better for contracting.
8166.22|8173.39|The government had changed from the NDP to Liberals, and Liberals were for contracting out work rather than
8173.83|8175.71|doing it with government crews.
8176.45|8181.56|So when I sold out, I said to the boys, "It never looks so good," but I said, "I'm finished.
8181.58|8182.3|I'm burned out.
8182.52|8185.29|I'm getting out of here right now.
8185.33|8187.43|After 20 years," I said, "I've had it."
8188.95|8194.74|And on the basis of that, they took over.
8195.04|8196.08|I gave them a good deal.
8196.16|8198.69|I didn't hijack them, hold them up for it or anything.
8200.37|8212.11|I forget the exact terms of what they paid me for the iron and whatnot, but it was under $100,000.
8212.29|8217.71|And they were to keep me on a salary of $1,000 a month for two years.
8218.51|8227.02|That was sort of an unwinding period for me, and I was to work a few hours a day as -
8227.69|8232.94|as was necessary, and as he called me in.
8234.98|8245.64|I might mention that along with selling the business, I kept the property, the shop and the land, and they were renting it from me.
8246.82|8250.22|And again, I gave them a good deal of $500 a month.
8251.88|8257.1|And throughout the years, as inflation went along, well, I sort of pulled it up.
8257.12|8260.88|And I might add that at no time have we ever had a contract.
8261.04|8264.33|It was all just word of mouth.
8264.35|8272.08|And as taxes would go up, I'd come along, and I don't think I raised the rent on them for six, seven years, and inflation was setting in.
8272.1|8276.52|So I come along one day, and I said, "Art, we've got to have a little more money."
8276.62|8279.44|And, well, they said, "Whatever you think."
8279.46|8279.5|So
8280.06|8287.51|I raised it to $600 a month, and then another couple of years, I raised it to $700 a month, and then inflation really come in.
8288.51|8303.69|And throughout the 20 years, no, less than that, in 16 years, I had it up to $1,325 a month.
8304.29|8309.34|And now for the last two years, I've kept it at that on the account of it
8310.53|8335.19|uh I didn't want to lose them as tenants and there were a lot of empty buildings showing up around the city and I thought, "Well, if I jacked them up and they move out then I've got a vacant building." The taxes there are over six thousand dollars a year so i'm quite happy to have them as tenants and uh Art sold out as -
8337.38|8342.81|When Art, Bill, and Vaughn and George took over, everything was going fine.
8343.49|8351.89|And the first setback they had was when Vaughn Kennedy was electrocuted doing some work at the Moose Jaw Airport.
8351.91|8354.83|Well, Art picked up his shares.
8356.25|8357.8|He left his family well off.
8357.82|8358.88|He was well insured.
8358.96|8362.76|He had four children, and his family had never suffered.
8363.64|8371.81|And I'm sure he didn't, because when electricity hits you, you don't know what hits you.
8371.83|8381.06|Then the next thing, George Jenney, he had saved his money, and he bought a section of land south of the Assiniboia.
8383.17|8388.44|And he decided he had worked 20 years, and he had his land paid for.
8388.5|8393.44|So he said, "This has been a wonderful experience, I'm getting out."
8394.23|8395.63|So he sold his shares.
8396.47|8408.06|And the next thing happened in another year, Bill Zaharitzuk took a heart attack and died in the middle of the - well in the middle of winter, out shoveling snow one day, and he dropped over dead.
8409.07|8421.88|So Art was sitting there with the whole business back in his hands, and he sold out a share to Doug McGillivray, who had been working for him for about eight, ten years.
8422.62|8423.6|And I don't know how
8424.44|8427.76|how big a chunk Doug McGillivray took.
8427.78|8452.72|And then a couple of years later, Con Bandy, who had worked for us for some years and had gone with the Power Corporation, got tired working for the Power Corporation, he come back and he took - bought in, or was going to buy in and buy out shares as he saw fit, but he was going to buy in to the company. And he only stayed about a year and a half, and I don't know -
8453.03|8459.84|I've never seen him or I've never asked why he left, but anyway, he sold his shares back into the company.
8460.66|8467.25|So Art is back there now with Doug, and the two of them are running the outfit.
8468.83|8474.78|Art's been out in the country pushing a crew, stringing in high-voltage underground wire.
8474.84|8477.65|They plow it in with the big caterpillars and a plow.
8478.39|8487.88|And he's been out, and he said, "It's like a holiday to get out in the country where there are no telephones or anything, and all you have to do is have your mind on one particular job."
8487.9|8496.11|And Doug McGillivray takes care of the office end of it, and works as well, the same as Art did.
8496.21|8498.64|Art never just sat behind a desk.
8498.66|8505.95|In the 20 years he was there, he would do the most menial work there was to do around there.
8506.55|8507.59|He was always busy.
8508.05|8514.22|He never just sat behind the desk and watched the world roll by.
8516.58|8519.63|So they're going on that basis now, and they seem to be busy.
8519.67|8520.35|A lot of work.
8522.17|8523.39|What is it now?
8523.41|8528.13|I sold out in '65, '66, '67.
8530.5|8535.9|This is in '66 - yeah that's -
8536.94|8538.87|22 years they've been going.
8540.55|8541.93|And the company still goes.
8541.95|8544.05|There's still some of the old-timers around there.
8544.67|8548.02|Ernie Smith is still there as mechanic and machine operator.
8549.44|8555.93|The two Cubians are both retired, but they come in once in a while when they're short-handed and help out.
8557.45|8561.77|And there's always new men coming in, and right now they have no problem getting help.
8561.79|8564.12|There's so darn much help around, I guess it's a nuicance, 
8564.86|8567.14|guys pounding at the door.
8568.82|8572.73|And I don't get down there very often to see them anymore.
8572.87|8576.53|It just seems every - every year less and less.
8577.47|8581.46|And they pay their rent every month on the dot, and they still -
8581.62|8590.83|Oh, yes, after my two years was up, they put me on a retainer because I had my electrician's journeyman license.
8591.65|8597.26|And there were jobs that they were doing that they had to have a journeyman electrician on the job.
8597.28|8603.25|And while I very seldom went out on the job, they always said, well, I've got an electrician.
8603.55|8608.12|And everybody knew the conditions and that was 
8608.14|8610.5|if it was necessary, I would be out there helping.
8610.52|8613.74|And if it wasn't, I wouldn't be.
8614.04|8619.67|And there's less and less of that where they call me in less and less all the time.
8620.39|8621.27|I don't think I've
8622.32|8624.24|been back there more than once in a year.
8625.02|8632.03|If there's anything they have to see the inspection department about, I always go up and handle that for them.
8632.05|8635.97|So, that's the way it wound up.
8637.27|8647.56|Oh yes, I started to tell you, when the two years was up, they wanted me on the retainer, so they put me on. Art said, "What do you want to come
8648.86|8651.77|and, you know, that we can use you if we want you."
8652.03|8653.87|I said, "Oh, I don't know."
8654.98|8658.66|Well, he said, "I'll have a couple thousand dollars a year sound to you."
8658.68|8660.22|I said, "That's good."
8660.24|8665.91|Well, I've been on that couple thousand dollars a year for 20 years now, and I don't do anything for it anymore.
8665.93|8671.72|It's just sort of a bonus to me.
8672.56|8679.83|But they still have a journeyman electrician on their payroll, which I guess it's worth a couple thousand to them to have me
8680.69|8683.09|just for a backup in case it's necessary.
8685.27|8688.18|So that's the way it all wound up.
8689.2|8710.29|And when I think back through the years from about '31 when I started working for the Power Commission, and I mentioned that earlier, and then I only worked for them eight months, and I took a leave of absence and I never went back.
8712.07|8733.21|Well, there's so many stories I could tell, things that happened through those years, even after I started contracting, what you run into, different individuals, and you were dealing with them throughout the years.
8733.33|8740.24|And I saw all the, when they were hiring young engineers, that all of a sudden these guys on my project.
8741.23|8769.18|Leave them there for two or three months and then pull them off and send another guy out. And I told the construction superintendent one time I said, "Why do you do that? I get a guy out there and he becomes some good to me and then you pull him off and send out a greenhorn." Well, he said - Ted said, "I sent him out there to learn something and I expect you'll teach them." "Well," I said, "That's what I've been doing but," I said, "I feel
8769.6|8782.15|pretty good about that you sent them to my outfit, but at the same time it doesn't help me out as much as it could if I had one man steady all the time."
8782.19|8794.67|Ted Durnan was the man that I dealt with from 1945 until about 1960.
8794.96|8797.87|That would be 15 years.
8798.49|8802.45|And he and I have a very good relationship.
8804.46|8807.2|He trusted me and I trusted him.
8807.34|8813.6|I'd be out in the country and there'd be something to do that the blueprints didn't fit and he'd give me authority.
8813.62|8816.75|You go ahead and put it the way you think.
8819.67|8823.69|The way you think it should be and then I'll back you up on it.
8823.75|8827.54|We never had any arguments over anything that
8828.46|8831.3|that I ever did, or I'd go and do a job.
8831.32|8833.95|He said, "To do the job, he'd send me a bill for it."
8833.97|8843.22|Well, knowing him, I knew that he would thoroughly analyze the bill, and he didn't put anything in there that wasn't yours, that was for sure.
8843.24|8847.33|And we went through that for the 15 years that he was there.
8847.35|8852.27|Then, after he left, another younger engineer took over.
8852.29|8856.78|By that time, things had changed an awful lot
8858.16|8887.05|in the power business. Oh yes - and just about then the new General Manager came in and he said, "We're going to contract more. So there was a sort of a period of, shall we say, when contractors weren't looked on by the general employees of the corporation as a necessity.
8887.3|8915.57|The union got in awfully strong. And they were all union men and we were non-union and of course they didn't like that because we could always show them up on production. So you had a - sort of always had an under feeling when you went to get material from their warehouse, you could sort of notice guys dragging their feet a bit and and you'd say, "Well that guy isn't very happy with
8916.35|8917.53|giving us this material.
8917.57|8918.19|It isn't his.
8918.27|8920.25|It belongs to the government.
8920.27|8922.27|But he's dragging his feet wherever he can."
8922.29|8928.92|Or if you got on the phone, you could tell when you phoned for something whether the guy was for you or against you.
8928.94|8935.6|Basically, we had the main engineering staff were all for us.
8935.62|8938.17|They liked the contractors.
8938.19|8945.69|And they finally got to a point where they had to tell some of the staff to either -
8946.52|8949.68|"Get in there and do your job.
8950.72|8954.93|If I hear one more bad report on you, you might be demoted."
8954.95|8957.21|And that sort of straightens things out.
8957.27|8960.52|This is after Art took over.
8962.26|8972.46|In the 20 years that I was contracting, it was interesting to see the young fellows starting up and couldn't make it.
8973.91|8976.97|They'd run a year or two, and then they would be belly up.
8978.21|8984.44|And then the corporation would nurse along some more upstarts.
8985.66|8990.77|And this, they watched an outfit like ours operate, and said, oh, that's pretty simple.
8991.47|9000.0|But they didn't realize all the things that you had to look after when you run an outfit single-handed.
9000.65|9002.75|You've got to do the hiring, the firing,
9003.44|9017.87|the dickering for wages, the buying the equipment, keeping the equipment running, family troubles you had to deal with.
9017.89|9024.96|There were so many things turned up that you wouldn't believe what would happen in the course of a year.
9026.02|9032.43|And having my background and experience is what carried me through. It was -
9033.05|9035.46|I knew a lot about machinery.
9035.58|9037.04|I'd been brought up on the farm.
9037.06|9041.06|We had all kinds of machinery of every description.
9041.08|9042.29|I knew all about men.
9042.55|9047.45|I hired and fired men when I was 21 years old.
9048.75|9051.46|And from there on, I was always in charge of people.
9053.48|9055.7|When I was on the farm, I was always in charge.
9055.8|9060.73|After Dad died, when I was 21 years old, three years I spent there.
9061.5|9069.35|Then when I started in the power business inside of a year and a half in there, I was always in charge of men.
9069.85|9076.64|Always in charge, no matter whether it was one man, three men, five men, or ten men, or twenty men.
9077.3|9079.63|I was always the foreman on the crew.
9079.65|9082.25|That way you got to know men and you could deal with men.
9082.31|9084.41|You always had problems when you had men.
9084.45|9090.82|They were always guys giving, you know, agitators, one thing or another that you had to deal with.
9092.35|9095.35|However, no unions.
9095.91|9098.24|We never had any union problems.
9098.26|9103.34|Even to this day, the union was never able to work its way into Achen Construction.
9103.36|9116.23|They tried and tried and tried, but we had a sort of a family arrangement there where the employees got a lot of benefits that you couldn't give if you were unionized.
9116.25|9120.02|In other words, it's like George Jenny said.
9120.3|9121.68|He was here about a month ago.
9121.8|9122.36|He said,
9123.25|9126.87|"What made your outfit go is you kept a good bunch of men around you."
9127.3|9128.78|I said, "And for sure."
9128.82|9130.8|I said, "If a guy didn't have it,
9130.84|9131.84|he didn't stay around.
9131.92|9133.18|You guys would run him off."
9133.2|9135.73|I said, "I didn't have to run him off.
9135.75|9136.83|They'd just fade away."
9138.45|9146.68|I had a good basic crew of about 10 men, and you could build that up to 40 or 50 men and really have production because you had good leaders.
9148.0|9149.27|And that's what enough it needed.
9150.01|9151.25|In the course of the years,
9151.84|9160.52|that I - when I was contracting, I saw over 30 fellows start up and go down.
9162.47|9174.06|And there's only, in those years, only a couple of other outfits that started up and stayed in the business, and they never got very big.
9175.44|9179.04|And I go back to 1958 when the -
9179.9|9181.98|the corporation had a meeting.
9182.0|9186.2|They said, "Look, a guy that's contracting is going to have an office.
9186.23|9187.19|He's going to have a phone.
9187.23|9196.9|And somebody on that phone that knows what's going on, that if we phone out there and want information, we want to be able to talk to somebody that knows what's going on."
9197.74|9209.03|And I was the only one that had an office set up where there was somebody in that office that - always there that could answer
9209.19|9239.17|anything that come up no matter what it was. And they let the other guys get by. Some of them set up little one-horse offices but didn't have anybody in there to man it, so they were no better off but that was one of the things they asked for and never got. But I don't know to relate back - Oh, we had a contractors' union. We started that way back in about 1950.
9239.97|9268.72|And it was to get the contractors sort of pulling together because the Power Corporation used to push the individuals around. It was something unbelievable and we could - together we could sort of spell out, "Look, we don't like this. You can't do this to us. We want this in our contracts, we want that in our contracts." And, while it never got to be a strong
9269.56|9274.06|organization, it still served a purpose.
9274.08|9279.85|It got us together with the engineers that were in charge, and they sort of got our viewpoints.
9281.29|9284.82|We'd always get a little out of them, but never what we really wanted.
9285.62|9292.39|They took the attitude, we're the guys with the work, and you guys have to come and get it.
9292.41|9296.59|There wasn't much you could do about it excepting, as I say, get them to
9296.94|9303.89|reword the contract a little bit so that it didn't hammer you to pieces if something went wrong.
9306.52|9307.64|And that went on.
9308.48|9309.98|I was the first president.
9310.1|9317.93|I was in there for three years as president, and I said, "Better put somebody else in here to run this organization."
9317.95|9320.77|I said, "I've been three years - in here three years and
9321.75|9323.17|And I've done mine."
9323.25|9327.98|So then they started up that they'd put a new president in every other year.
9328.86|9331.94|And we were only eight or nine members. That's all we were.
9333.76|9334.99|And that's still going today.
9335.07|9342.7|That same Central Line Contractors Association is still operating today.
9342.74|9348.88|They get together once a year and get together with the power, talk things over to see how things are going.
9348.94|9351.39|And it looks as though it can go on forever.
9351.91|9365.81|Basically, the union have got so tough and so organized that it hampers the Power Corporation in anything they want to do.
9365.95|9368.39|They've got to see the union first.
9368.41|9372.92|I've had them call me out at Christmas time to do jobs.
9372.94|9377.18|When we all closed down and they were closed down, I said, "You've got 150 men out there.
9377.2|9378.47|What are you calling on me for?
9378.61|9379.89|A little one-horse outfit."
9380.59|9390.69|"Oh, God, if we were going to do that job, we'd have to advertise it first and then let them come in the seniority until we got the amount of men we want to do it.
9390.79|9392.65|By that time, you can have the job done."
9394.09|9395.97|Well, I did the job for them.
9396.03|9399.44|I said, "Look, you know what this is going to be working over Christmas?
9400.3|9404.91|There's about three days' work, and there's going to be about three days' holiday I'm going to have to pay.
9406.53|9408.27|Christmas Day, Boxing Day."
9409.77|9438.68|"Oh, that's all right you go ahead and do it send us the bill for it." When I sent in the bill the guy looked at it, he said, "I can't pay that!" He said. "I -" "Well," I said, "You're the guy told me that you would." "Oh no. No way can I stand that much overtime. If I send that in, God, my job might be on trial." Well, he's got me over the barrel so he sort of dictated the the terms. We'll take this off, we'll take that off and -
9439.77|9441.2|But what else could you do?
9441.24|9446.9|You were looking for work, and this was your bread and butter was the Power Corporation.
9446.92|9450.73|So you had to accept that, and they would take advantage of you occasionally.
9451.33|9453.47|They never gave you the long end of the stick.
9453.49|9461.13|They always took the long end of the stick because they were in the driver's seat, and I suppose maybe I would have been the same had I been in there.
9461.49|9466.03|And incidentally, I might mention that in 1948,
9468.12|9477.11|Ted Durnan, I was in Ted Durnan's office as the head construction superintendent.
9477.13|9485.96|He said, "How much would you take a year to come in and run our construction department?"
9485.98|9489.09|And I thought for a while.
9489.25|9490.29|I said, "$10,000 a year."
9491.39|9493.27|But there'll be no contracting.
9493.29|9495.19|If I come in, contracting's finished.
9495.98|9498.57|As long as it's contracting, I want to be a competitor.
9498.65|9499.75|I'll be out there and be in it.
9500.63|9503.41|"Hell!" he said, "I can't pay you $10,000 a year.
9503.45|9504.77|I only get $8,000."
9504.93|9506.43|I said, "I don't care what you get.
9507.1|9511.76|I figure I'm worth $10,000 a year to run your construction crew."
9513.94|9515.68|"Well, no," he said, "We can't do that."
9515.7|9522.87|So he took one of their other fellows, and nobody will ever know what that cost them to.
9523.97|9525.33|But I could have saved them
9525.84|9527.64|with my knowledge.
9527.66|9534.79|They had nobody that had the knowledge that I had in construction, or had the wide variety of experience.
9535.51|9540.73|He brought it up to me then. "Well," he said, "You've got a history of jumping around a lot."
9540.75|9546.0|"Well," I said, "I never left a job that I didn't better myself going to the next one."
9546.04|9549.91|And,I said, "I picked up an awful lot of experience in that time.
9549.95|9553.05|I worked for the Iowa Electric to start with.
9553.07|9554.51|That was only about
9555.17|9555.91|four months.
9557.07|9565.72|And from there I went, that was in Iowa, and then I went to South Dakota, and I worked for the Northern Light Power for about a year and a half.
9565.74|9573.41|And then I went into North Dakota, and I worked for the Montana-Dakota Power Company.
9573.47|9575.52|I was there about six months.
9576.7|9584.11|Then I went up into Canada, and I worked for the Dominion Electric Power for about
9586.32|9587.06|'31 to '45.
9588.7|9594.43|That's about 15, 16 years.
9594.51|9595.11|Not steady.
9595.19|9596.39|I was on and off.
9596.41|9613.99|But I worked in every possible capacity that you could work on on a job, including running diesel plants and calibrating meters and building switchboards and shooting trouble of every description, rewinding transformers.
9614.67|9621.11|I've got a hell of an experience, and all this time in charge of men, which was a great thing to be in charge."
9621.13|9632.93|So I pointed out to him, I said, "Look, with my experience," I said, "you haven't got anybody around here that can even come up with an itinerary that worked any place excepting for the Power Commission.
9632.95|9635.49|And you think that I wouldn't be worth that much money to run it all?"
9635.51|9638.89|"Oh," he said, "I can't - I couldn't consider that."
9638.91|9640.41|Well, the result was I was happy.
9640.47|9642.18|I kept on contracting, and -
9642.83|9646.79|and run out my 20 years when I said "That's it".
9646.81|9659.71|After I'd shut down one day and calculated that I had enough money to keep me for the rest of my life at the style of living that I was accustomed to.
9660.27|9663.99|Had I known what inflation was going to do, I'd have been afraid to retire.
9664.83|9670.58|However, the inflation sort of took care of itself because when I retired,
9670.89|9699.38|six percent was the interest and it never stopped going up and so my income kept on doubling as I went along and never - never suffered for want of money. Every year after I retired I always had more money than I took in so that kept on pyramiding and cost of living kept on pyramiding of course. So that all took care of itself it was like a
9700.44|9728.46|"index pension" is what it was like as far as I was concerned. And uh what'll we go back to now. Yes some of the years that I was contracting. I have to take a look and see if this machine is still going. Yes it's still going but I must be getting near the end of this side of the tape when that runs out
9729.47|9738.7|I may just wind up, and I don't know what else I would talk on on the other side.
9738.74|9746.49|There's so much detail, incidents that I could tell that happened throughout those years.
9746.49|9748.79|I had labor trouble, sure.
9748.91|9754.02|I had guys - they'd go on strike right out on the job, and I'd go out and settle it right there.
9754.04|9755.12|"Okay, what's your problem?
9755.5|9757.17|Let's get this thing - okay.
9757.19|9758.11|Get back to work."
9758.66|9761.04|"Well, we want five cents an hour or more salary."
9761.06|9763.51|"Okay, I'll give you five cents an hour or more salary.
9763.91|9764.69|Get going.
9764.71|9765.91|Don't stand around here."
9765.93|9767.31|I said, "This is costing money."
9768.53|9770.54|You could talk to them in that tone
9771.34|9785.06|,in those days, I'm talking back in 1946, up to 1950, I had a bunch go on strike up - way up north of Swift Current.
9785.08|9786.12|It was the first time
9786.35|9799.63|I ever had all my men staying in one place, and we got into a small village there, and we rented a big hall, and we got bunk beds and put them up in there, about 18 or 20 men, and that's when trouble started.
9799.65|9814.08|There were some young fellows in there that were students and, you know, didn't believe in drinking beer and having a lot of fun and raising hell at night, and it wasn't long, and there was trouble in camp, and
9814.74|9818.36|Art Miller and I were both in town here, and we got in the car and drove out there.
9818.86|9827.85|Didn't take me long to sort it out when I got out there, and I said, "Who's the ringleader here, and what's your problem?"
9828.51|9839.8|And he still - Well, I said, "Okay, you'll take charge of this wire stringing crew right now, and you better, bloddy well, do a job of it, or down the road you'll go, and no fooling about it."
9839.82|9842.58|And a couple of guys automatically quit - 
9842.78|9845.41|left the crew and they quit.
9845.43|9852.01|And they went back to work, and they did a good summer's work for me.
9852.17|9855.86|That whole summer, that was, that happened in June.
9855.88|9863.42|And we had a hell of a year, that year; a big year. But everybody went to work and that was the end of it.
9863.44|9872.45|Then in about two years later, I - Bill Zaharitzuk was out at Swift Current with a small crew, and he had
9872.87|9876.43|four guys climbing poles out there.
9876.97|9878.3|One day, they take a notion.
9878.32|9881.18|They're climbing creosote poles, and they take a notion.
9881.2|9886.77|They want a dollar a day more for climbing black poles.
9888.71|9891.33|And Bill said, well, I'll phone the boss tonight.
9891.39|9892.85|Oh, no, we're going in to see them.
9892.87|9896.72|And they jump in a truck, and they come into my house in Regina here.
9896.74|9900.7|And I said, "What in the world are you guys doing here?"
9901.79|9902.9|"Oh, we're on strike.
9902.92|9903.9|We want more money."
9905.84|9909.98|I said, "Why didn't you phone in instead of coming in here?"
9910.8|9912.2|"Oh, no, we want to -"
9912.26|9914.17|Well, I said, "You're all fired right now.
9914.75|9916.47|If that's your attitude."
9916.75|9917.77|"Well, what are you going to do?
9917.81|9919.27|You've got 200 farms to build.
9919.29|9921.77|Who's going to string that wire tied in it?"
9921.79|9924.59|"Don't you worry about that." I said.
9924.84|9927.54|"Art Miller, Bill Zaharitzuk, and I will take care of that.
9927.68|9929.2|You fellas don't have to worry about it."
9929.82|9930.94|And down the road they went,
9931.49|9934.38|all four of them.
9934.4|9935.7|I used to call them the whiz kids.
9935.76|9945.41|They were a good bunch of workers, but they thought they were going to take control of things because they were the whiz kids.
9945.43|9948.73|Well, as it happened, they all scattered, went their own way.
9949.62|9954.4|One of them was my nephew, Don Achen, who was a hell of a good man.
9954.42|9959.85|If he'd have stayed with the outfit, I'm sure he would have gone right to the top.
9960.64|9967.72|Another one we hired, oh yeah, when they were all gone, Art said, "I want Eddie Vizcerna back."
9967.74|9969.81|He said, "He's a hell of a good kid.
9969.83|9975.37|He's only 19 years old, but he said he's been my pet ever since he come here."
9975.45|9976.47|"Well," I said, "You go and hire him."
9976.67|9987.74|So Eddie Vizcerna come back, and unfortunately, that winter, we were stringing wire in the city here, and he was climbing up a pole, and he went too high and walked into the 4,000 with his head
9988.73|9994.82|And bang, up was the end of Eddy right there.
9995.22|9998.11|So those were some of the problems.
9999.69|10001.93|Oh, you had - Had another guy
10001.95|10003.51|who had family troubles.
10003.53|10004.68|A hell of a good man.
10004.88|10007.7|He was a man about my age.
10007.72|10009.66|And he brought his kids into the city.
10009.68|10012.23|And, cripes, they went wild in the city here.
10012.27|10013.61|And he was out in the country.
10013.63|10017.27|And he used to tell me to look in on them.
10018.03|10022.25|And I tried to follow the one boy.
10022.27|10023.76|He was trying to get his grade eight.
10023.78|10025.5|He was about sixteen years old.
10026.44|10035.47|And, hell, he wasn't going to school, and the schoolteachers would phone me up, and I was a truant officer, amongst other things.
10035.49|10044.36|And those were probably, as I recall, the only two real
10044.84|10046.24|problems I had with -
10046.26|10047.77|Oh, you had guys going down the road.
10047.79|10048.57|They're fired -
10049.35|10053.69|I fired a guy down near Assiniboia.
10053.71|10061.18|He was running a camping crew, and I happened to come into town at one o'clock in the afternoon, and here the outfit was standing still.
10061.74|10064.32|When I go up to the hotel, I see the trucks staying there.
10064.34|10066.91|I go in, and here they come out of the beer parlor.
10066.93|10067.87|He was drunk as hell.
10067.91|10070.03|I said, "You're fired right now, Owen.
10071.05|10072.41|You're finished right now.
10072.45|10072.79|And that's
10073.51|10075.62|The first time I told you, I said, you're finished.
10075.64|10077.6|Not the second."
10077.62|10078.44|"Oh," he said, "Fired?"
10078.48|10079.52|I said, "Yeah, fired."
10080.69|10083.43|The rest of them went back to work.
10083.45|10087.07|And then they pull up their britches when they see a thing like that happen.
10087.15|10095.43|And one of my old diggers, George Kukachuk, pulled a boner - not a boner, just a dirty, rotten trick, burying an anchor.
10096.57|10101.52|And took some shortcuts to make it look like we'd done a hell of a sweetheart of a job.
10101.54|10102.68|And just by chance,
10103.75|10108.28|they changed the construction design on that corner, and I had to dig these anchors out.
10108.36|10111.64|When I saw what he'd done, I said, "You're finished right now, George.
10111.74|10120.05|My God, a man of your age and how much work you've done in your day, and you would pull a trick like that on a guy that's used you the way I used you."
10120.07|10121.89|I said, "You're done right now, George.
10121.91|10123.96|You're fired."
10123.98|10128.14|Those were probably the only two men I ever fired right on the job.
10131.27|10131.69|I said -
10132.36|10137.69|I had one other fall when I was working for the power company in Estevan.
10137.71|10141.31|And as soon as the superintendent was out of town, he'd start hollering.
10141.33|10144.01|He wanted his pay slip so that he could go out and get a better job.
10145.1|10148.06|And every time the superintendent left, he'd start that and keep on -
10148.2|10151.3|And that upset the other men, you know.
10151.32|10155.37|So this night, Dubois phoned me from Peace River.
10155.39|10158.17|He's up there on a project.
10158.19|10158.86|He phoned me
10158.9|10159.88|(that's the superintendent).
10160.0|10160.78|He phoned me and
10161.43|10163.58|had me to send some things up to him.
10163.6|10165.14|So I said, "What about Walden?"
10165.16|10170.06|I said, every time you leave town, he comes in and says, He wants to quit.
10170.08|10171.2|"Where's the superintendent?
10171.24|10172.94|I want to quit."
10172.96|10178.99|He said, "If he wants to quit, go over to the unemployment insurance and get a slip, and you sign it," he said.
10180.85|10183.67|That he can quit, you know.
10183.87|10184.97|That was during the war.
10185.01|10187.28|You had to get a slip to leave your job.
10188.02|10189.4|The boss had to release you.
10189.44|10191.44|So the next morning, this guy comes -
10191.69|10195.15|comes out of work and here's his quit slip laying on the desk.
10196.68|10198.72|Well, you never saw a guy.
10200.54|10201.58|He didn't mean it.
10201.94|10202.7|He didn't mean it.
10202.74|10206.11|I said, "Bob, every time Dubois is out of town, you ask for a quit slip?
10206.35|10209.99|There it is, and I have the authority to sign it."
10210.01|10216.88|Well - "Three days, you're finished, or tonight if you want to quit."
10216.9|10218.22|Well, he quit that night.
10222.39|10230.52|That's about the only recollection I have of where I really had to -
10230.54|10233.68|Oh, you had guys all the time that you had to - that would -
10234.56|10246.68|When I was working for the power company, guys nipping at your heels all the time, trying to make you trouble and whatnot, but you just brush them aside and keep on going.
10246.7|10249.12|You didn't pay too much attention to them.
10253.49|10254.55|I'm still looking.
10254.57|10256.11|I can't see whether this - 
10256.31|10257.67|Yes, it's still going.
10257.73|10261.14|I'm running out of talk.
10262.32|10271.05|I think I'll have to just make up a few things as I go along now.
10274.6|10280.29|After you've read this tape and analyze it,
10280.66|10295.72|you'll probably have a lot of questions to ask me the next time you see me, some of the details that go into such things as looking after machinery and equipment.
10295.74|10299.18|That's a long story, looking after our machines.
10300.97|10303.53|We never bought but very little equipment new.
10303.57|10307.35|Trucks! We bought new trucks, but other boring machines,
10308.23|10313.11|and cranes and things like that would buy second-handed and fix them up in our shop.
10313.83|10323.85|And if you saw some of the things that they did with the little equipment, you'd say it was impossible, such as making an auger.
10323.87|10326.85|We made all our augers for our earth-boring equipment.
10326.87|10328.55|We had six earth-boring machines.
10329.35|10331.17|And we used to wheel them out in the wintertime.
10331.21|10337.46|They'd make them up to, oh, as much as 30- and 40-inch augers.
10338.45|10341.07|We designed augers that would dig through frost.
10342.56|10345.14|No manufacturer made augers like we did.
10345.62|10352.21|When they got the screw-in anchors, instead of paying $15 for one, we could build one for $10.
10352.53|10356.75|And a better anchor than the factory had designed.
10356.77|10360.69|The big factory in the States was turning them out by the thousands.
10360.71|10366.84|And we designed a better auger right in our own shop and built them right there.
10368.17|10369.99|Oh, so many things.
10370.01|10382.9|We'd buy these old machines that somebody else couldn't make go and make a few improvements on them and go out and dig all year, no problems.
10382.92|10384.52|And they'd say, "How come
10384.91|10389.05|that machine was always in the shop when we had it."
10389.07|10391.27|"Well, you didn't have the right kind of man on it."
10392.07|10397.2|You didn't tell them about the little things that you fixed that had been driving them crazy.
10399.67|10401.9|We bought one that the city had.
10404.86|10406.69|We spent about $600 on it.
10409.63|10414.6|We dug more footage with it the first year we had it than what they had dug in 10 years.
10415.82|10424.97|And they had it in the shop, and they had bills for $1,000, $2,000 repairs on it.
10425.27|10427.58|They couldn't figure it out, you know.
10427.6|10430.42|Well, I said, "It's all on the man you put on it."
10430.44|10436.87|I said, "You get the right guy to run your machine and train him the proper way, and you won't have any trouble."
10437.23|10444.98|We bought a Williams boring machine from Billings, Montana, and it would only go down 18 feet.
10445.0|10446.89|And we wanted to go down 30 feet.
10448.47|10453.14|So the guy was up from the factory one day, and he told me, "Oh," he said, "That machine,
10453.76|10454.72|it won't stand up.
10454.82|10456.66|The frame and everything isn't heavy enough."
10458.38|10468.81|We extended it ourselves in our own shop that it would go down 30 feet, and never anything went wrong with it, and we had it for 15 years.
10469.4|10471.56|The only thing with it was clutch trouble.
10471.76|10473.62|We always had clutch trouble, clutch trouble.
10473.66|10483.63|We got the trouble book with it when we bought it from Billings, and the guy from the factory had been up there half a dozen times, couldn't figure why they were throwing clutches all the time.
10484.57|10490.2|And after we had it a couple of years, this guy was up from the factory, and he got up and crawled in there.
10490.22|10491.32|He couldn't figure it out.
10492.74|10495.38|The next day, I had never looked in the transmission.
10495.42|10497.24|The next day, I went and took a look.
10497.32|10500.39|I said, "Hell, you haven't got enough clutch in this machine.
10500.41|10507.15|Look, you've got the same kind of clutch out here doing the job that this one is doing, and you've got a three-to-one ratio.
10507.17|10509.24|So how do you expect this clutch to stand up?"
10511.12|10512.82|Art Miller measured it up. And "God,"
10512.84|10514.14|he said, "We can double that -
10514.48|10518.72|twin this clutch. You can add on as many segments as you have room for."
10519.8|10525.65|He got on the phone and phoned Edmonton and got the repairs and put it in, and we never did have clutch trouble after that.
10526.65|10536.38|Previous to that, when I was nosing around to see what the Power Corporation had, one competitor, George Carmine, up in -
10537.32|10541.27|in Lloydminster had one, asked him, "What do you do for clutch?"
10541.29|10542.95|"Oh, we never have clutch trouble."
10543.55|10545.04|"No? never have clutch trouble?
10545.26|10547.58|Power Corporation never have clutch trouble?"
10547.6|10551.73|So after we've got ours fixed, that noise gets around, the men get talking, you know.
10552.29|10557.9|Then they started phoning me up, hey, what do you do to your clutch that you're not having clutch trouble?
10559.04|10560.28|Well, I said, "Why do you ask?"
10561.0|10562.2|"Well, we're having trouble."
10562.22|10565.09|"Well," I said, "When I asked you fellas what to do,
10566.1|10570.66|you all said you didn't have, you and George Carmine both said, never had any clutch trouble."
10571.34|10573.56|About a year later, George Carmine phones me up.
10573.58|10575.42|"Hey," he said, "What did you do with your clutch?"
10577.1|10581.91|"Well," I said, made it - doubled the capacity of it.
10581.93|10582.99|But I said, "Why do you ask?
10583.03|10584.25|You never had clutch trouble."
10584.33|10586.37|"Oh, yeah, we've always had some clutch trouble."
10586.41|10589.1|"Well," I said, "When I asked you, you said you never had trouble."
10590.64|10595.36|And those were some of the things that you run into -
10595.56|10599.36|make you laugh, you know, if you apply a little moxy.
10599.38|10608.79|The Power Corporation had engineers try to design a pole straightener, a machine that could grab a pole and straighten it up and hold it there while they tamped it in.
10610.34|10615.2|And so one day I said to Art, "Let's build a pole straightener."
10617.06|10618.09|"Well, what do we make?"
10618.19|10620.37|Well, I explained to him what I had in mind.
10620.41|10622.41|"Go over to the lumber yard and get a bunch of lap."
10623.23|10625.5|He went over and got a bundle of lap, and we come out.
10626.7|10632.91|I drew a picture on the cement floor with a piece of chalk of what it should look like.
10633.13|10645.83|And then we built one out of - a mock-up out of lap, you know, and see how you could jackknife the thing and move it in different directions.
10645.85|10651.01|Art went ahead and built that thing in the shop, put it on a truck,
10651.45|10680.51|and never changed one thing. And we used it for five, six years never changed a thing on design or on equipment or anything. It just went out and it did its job. And the Power Corporation said, "God we spent thousands of dollars trying to design one." Then I said to Art, "Go ahead and put one on each boring machine, put one up on the head of the boring machine that you can grab it swing the boom back and forth and straighten the pole out."
10681.47|10686.82|He designed one, put it on, never changed a dang thing on it.
10693.27|10696.75|Now I'm talking about equipment.
10702.52|10710.24|Yesterday I talked into this thing for about 20 minutes and found out I didn't have it on - in gear for taping.
10710.82|10712.48|So now I have to go over the whole thing again.
10712.52|10720.15|And I'll still stay with the equipment, which is one of the big factors in building a power line is that you're properly equipped at all times.
10721.09|10726.42|We'd have 12, 13 trucks out on the road, and most of them had special equipment on them.
10727.82|10729.21|And it had to do its job.
10730.25|10733.13|And if it didn't, you were losing time on the job.
10733.15|10736.54|Your production was down.
10736.56|10738.18|I go back to boring machines.
10738.24|10739.46|I never bought a new machine.
10741.39|10745.73|I may have said this earlier on the tape.
10747.6|10751.25|I'd tell about buying the machine down at Billings, Montana.
10752.61|10759.94|Driving through there, one day I saw this machine and phoned back after I got home and found out it was for sale, so I sent Art down to buy it.
10760.98|10767.55|And it was a machine that was almost in, as Danny would say, in mint condition.
10768.31|10774.24|But it would only drill 20 feet deep, so we brought it up and we converted it to go down 32 feet.
10775.62|10778.04|And the fellow from the factory is up here in the meantime.
10780.24|10781.14|Salesman, I should say.
10781.66|10782.87|"Oh," he said, "You can't do that."
10782.93|10785.53|He said, "That machine, the frame and everything isn't heavy enough."
10785.59|10786.91|Well, we did it.
10786.93|10788.63|And we never had any trouble with the frame.
10789.2|10794.26|But the machine had a history of bad clutch problems.
10794.28|10799.21|While it was in Billings, they had a correspondence with the factory on it.
10799.23|10801.39|And they had experts up there two or three times.
10801.47|10805.44|And we had all this, got this file with it, when we got the machine.
10806.26|10808.14|And we were taking out clutches all the time.
10809.15|10813.05|Well, not often, but every so often the clutch would go out.
10813.09|10816.06|So I inquired from the Power Corporation.
10816.08|10816.66|They had one.
10816.68|10818.86|"Oh, no, we never have clutch trouble.
10818.88|10820.56|I don't know why you're having clutch trouble."
10821.3|10822.93|So then I went to George Carmine.
10822.97|10824.21|He had one of the machines.
10824.67|10826.79|"No," he said, "Never have any clutch trouble.
10828.85|10830.64|I don't know why you're having clutch trouble." So -
10832.3|10835.1|Anyway, when they had it apart one day, I looked up in
10835.89|10846.47|the mechanism and I said, "You know we haven't got enough clutch in here. I said the one I had about it's the same size and we've got a three to one ratio, so how do you expect this one to stand up?"
10846.47|10864.79|Well it was a twin disc clutch and you can add and add on to them. So Art measured up and found out there's room enough to double the capacity of the clutch. Got on the phone, phoned Edmonton, got the unnecessary parts, and took it to a machine shop, had a few alterations made and
10865.86|10868.69|put it in, and that was the end of our clutch trouble.
10868.73|10870.93|No problems, whatever, after that.
10871.97|10875.82|About a year later, the noise got around.
10875.84|10878.08|The men get talking, you know.
10878.1|10879.7|The noise got around.
10879.72|10883.46|I got a phone call from the Power Corporation one day.
10883.5|10887.07|"Hey, what did you do with your clutch that you're not having any clutch trouble?"
10888.27|10892.2|"Well," I said, "I just doubled the capacity of it.
10892.24|10893.02|Why do you ask?"
10893.6|10895.82|"Well, we're having clutch trouble, and -
10896.69|10907.54|and uh we were wondering what you did." "Well, when I asked you guys about clutch trouble you said you never had any trouble. So now when I get mine fixed now you want to fix yours the same way."
10907.54|10922.31|Less than a month later I had a call from George Carmine; same thing. "Hey what did you do to fix your clutch?" "Well," I said, "You're the guy never had any clutch trouble and when I asked you for information
10922.72|10924.52|you said, never have any clutch trouble.
10924.6|10926.7|Now you're having clutch trouble."
10926.72|10929.44|"Well, we always did have some, but it wasn't that bad."
10930.42|10935.21|Well, anyway, I told them how to fix their machines, and that was the end of that.
10935.23|10937.59|But I got quite a kick out of it when I inquired.
10937.67|10942.08|"No, nobody ever had any clutch trouble."
10943.38|10945.32|We bought the second-handed the machines.
10945.34|10950.01|We would take them in and find their weakness.
10952.21|10969.1|the city had one, ten years old and they had it in their machine shop all the time. And they traded and got a new one and I bought the dang thing for $2,000 and it was about - well if you bought a new one it'd be $15,000 so -
10969.1|10982.15|We took it and we spent $600 on it. And we dug more footage with that machine in one year than what they had dug in the ten years they had, and we never had any trouble with it. These guys couldn't figure out how
10982.4|10983.52|you know, "How did you do that?"
10983.54|10985.67|"Well," I said, "Got to have good operators."
10986.73|10995.84|I didn't give them any of the secrets, some of the things that they hadn't found fault with, and we recognized it immediately and altered it.
10997.64|10999.54|So that was the history of machines.
10999.58|11005.23|I bought two used machines down at Devil Lakes - Devils Lake, North Dakota, and I brought them up here.
11006.69|11010.87|And I wouldn't have defied anybody to dig a hole with either one of those machines.
11011.16|11016.44|And the guy said that just the way they came off of the job and they were standing in the yard, he went out of business.
11017.22|11024.27|I bought them and we brought them up here and spent considerable money overhauling them and got them in shape.
11024.67|11026.71|Used those machines for 10 years after that.
11027.22|11030.12|I think I gave them $2,000 apiece for them.
11030.6|11034.98|And again, a $10,000 machine, if you bought a new one, that would do the same kind of a job.
11035.6|11039.73|It was interesting to see how we could take this old junk and make it work, and that was
11040.23|11044.34|part of our success was to keep the overhead down.
11044.42|11051.07|Power Corporation asked me one time how much I spent on boring machines, and I told them. We had four machines at that time.
11051.09|11054.33|He said, "We spend more than that on one machine in a year."
11055.6|11057.66|"Well," I said, "You haven't got the operators."
11057.8|11064.49|You've got to have the right men operating it and, of course, overhauling it as well.
11066.23|11067.25|So that's
11068.19|11070.56|gives you an idea what you run into for equipment.
11071.04|11075.45|I went over the manpower, and now I come back to the finance.
11075.51|11087.06|I may have told you something about that in the start, but throughout the years, I've never had any trouble financing.
11087.08|11094.67|I think I told you I had $3,000 in the bank when I started, and I went to the bank manager in Estevan and told him I might need a little
11095.13|11124.22|extra money and he said, "Well how much you got?" And, I said, "I got three thousand dollars in bonds in the safety deposit box." I said, "You want me to put them up for collateral?" "No," he said, "You go ahead," and he said, "I'll just run you on overdraft until - and charge you interest on it." In those days they allowed you to run on overdraft. With the result that I never had to sign a note of any description. I operated out of Estevan
11124.95|11127.41|from '45 and then '48 when I come up here.
11128.27|11136.42|I said to the fellow in the bank, "There's one thing I want understood now when we start.
11137.18|11139.36|I don't ever want one of my cheques turned down.
11140.04|11145.17|If there isn't enough money in the bank to cover it, you cover it until I get there to take care of it."
11146.25|11150.85|And I said, "If you don't, I'll move my account to Moose Jaw where my old friend Bill Mullins
11151.42|11156.25|who started me up in Estevan, is the manager at Moose Jaw, and he'll take care of me."
11157.21|11174.19|Well, I never did have a check turned down on overdraft, no matter - One time I was overdrawn about $10,000, and there was a relief manager in, and he called me, and he said, "Hey, your account's getting pretty badly overdrawn."
11174.21|11179.03|He said, "I think we'd better take a look at that."
11179.59|11181.75|I said, "What are you worrying about that for?"
11181.89|11184.33|I said, "I think I've got to worry about that."
11185.15|11196.21|He didn't know that at that particular time I had about $30,000 worth of work done, which I hadn't invoiced, which would wipe out the $10,000 in a hurry.
11198.25|11209.0|One time in the spring of the year, I needed quite a bit of money, and I give them a $5,000 government bond for security.
11209.56|11212.34|There was another manager come in and he was a little shaky.
11213.32|11218.95|So I put that up until I had my overdraft taken care of.
11218.97|11233.4|And then I forgot that they had it and that fall when I went in to get it, I thought I'd better cash it in and here I'd run overtime and had to take a penalty for not cashing it in on the due date.
11233.42|11235.14|I don't think they have that anymore.
11236.57|11241.02|So I always got along well with financing, never had any trouble.
11242.16|11247.49|I could complete a job and then invoice the Power Corporation for it.
11247.51|11255.27|Evidently, all the other contractors were always, when they'd get a couple weeks' work done, they'd invoice on it, invoice on it.
11255.29|11260.3|Ted Durnan, the superintendent, said to me one day, he said, "I think you're making too damn much money."
11261.56|11262.78|I said, "Why do you say that?"
11263.24|11266.26|"Well," he said, "All the other guys are subbing all the time and you're not."
11266.28|11268.64|"Well," I said, "I'm working for the same price they're working."
11270.3|11272.33|But I said, "I've got news for you.
11273.09|11280.82|My credit is good enough at the bank that I could build lines all summer and invoice you for it in the fall."
11280.84|11287.55|And I said, "So it's not that I'm making too much money, but," I said, "I've got a good credit established."
11289.75|11291.69|So I went along.
11293.44|11300.99|Oh, in 1954, they had a big sleet storm in Manitoba, and they took down all the telephone lines in southern Manitoba.
11301.77|11308.42|And they come to Saskatchewan for help, see if we could rig up some small three-man crews on half-ton trucks.
11310.11|11318.02|So they came to me, and I don't know how they got a hold of my name, and asked how many outfits I could send out, three-man crews.
11318.34|11320.24|They would supervise them once they got out there.
11320.98|11325.35|So I phoned all the contractors, and I rounded up 12 outfits.
11325.37|11329.59|This was, oh, early in the spring, about early May or the end of April.
11331.91|11334.42|Between all the contractors, I lined up 12 outfits.
11335.08|11337.5|Two of my own were in that.
11337.52|11339.58|Well, then I found out how the guys were operating.
11339.68|11345.57|Most of them had me sub them for money to buy a license before they could get going.
11348.39|11349.99|I paid them.
11350.61|11379.83|Every two weeks I paid them out for their units and I didn't get any money until the whole job was finished. And when it was finished it came to - I think was $38,000 and I invoiced the government telephones in Manitoba for that much money. And that was the biggest check I had ever received up to that date. On that I owned - I didn't know how much I should charge -
11380.69|11386.66|take off, you know, for supervising the operation.
11388.92|11390.32|So I took ten percent.
11390.84|11392.14|That's what I got for it.
11392.16|11398.63|It was all over in a, I think our outfits were down there maybe three weeks or something like that.
11398.65|11406.76|So I got paid $3,800 for my three weeks, and it was all office work as far as I was concerned.
11406.78|11408.67|Telephoned a lot of telephone calls.
11410.59|11413.71|And what were some of the other highlights?
11415.53|11424.48|I told you about the last job I did, which was the biggest individual job I had ever bid on, which was just under $200,000.
11424.63|11432.43| And didn't - I made some money on it, but didn't get wealthy on it; put it that way.
11435.52|11439.26|And I don't know.
11440.41|11442.13|All in all, it was interesting.
11442.35|11447.62|I may have told you before that Ted Durnan tried to hire me one time to run their whole construction outfit.
11447.64|11448.66|That was in 1949.
11448.68|11457.63|He asked me what I'd take, and I said I'd take $10,000 a year, but there'd be no contracting.
11457.67|11461.56|As long as there was contracting, I wanted to be in on the competitive field.
11463.52|11466.37|And he said, "Hell, I can't pay you $10,000 a year.
11466.39|11467.25|I only get $8,000."
11467.37|11468.81|"Well,"
11469.03|11475.13|I said, "I figure I'm worth $10,000 to run your construction outfit with my experience."
11476.55|11478.78|So that was the end of that.
11478.9|11480.96|They set up a different arrangement.
11481.54|11484.9|I think Jack Bell was sort of put in charge of the construction.
11486.24|11487.23|They never looked back.
11487.25|11491.81|They got so big at that time that money was nothing to them.
11493.07|11496.43|They just kept on expanding and expanding and expanding,
11497.95|11499.51|until the Union got a hold of it,
11499.53|11510.79|and then all of a sudden they got in a squeeze where the Union was running the outfit instead of themselves.
11513.31|11523.44|And I've had them come to me when they had trouble, or not trouble, but they had a customer just out of Regina here that had to have service just at Christmas time.
11523.82|11527.59|They'd come to me and ask if I couldn't rustle up a crew to go out and do this job that would take
11528.22|11530.15|maybe four, five, or six days.
11530.67|11537.62|And in that came Christmas Day, Boxing Day, and the Sunday and all, and they wanted to go out and work right straight through until it was finished.
11538.98|11543.26|And I said, "That's going to cost you a lot of money, a lot of overtime in there for the amount of work we do."
11544.03|11545.35|"That don't make any difference."
11545.37|11549.83|But when I present them with a bill, "Oh, we can't stand that overtime.
11549.85|11550.53|No way."
11550.57|11557.3|The guy, the engineer in charge said, "If I presented that, I said, my job could be on the,
11557.76|11574.59|on the line." And he said, "You're going to have to cut back and stand half that overtime yourself." Which meant that I made damn little on the job but that's the way - They would take advantage of you occasionally when they got you over the barrel.
11574.59|11583.88|All in all, I will have to say they treated me pretty fair I had - I had a lot of leeway with them and with this man Durnan,
11584.1|11598.75|we had a lot of trust in each other although, he was a tight one. Boy, he wouldn't - he'd give you authority to do things but don't ever try to to pad the invoice or anything like that or he'd be right on you in a minute.
11601.47|11613.29|But it all went on and on. While that was going on, I think I related earlier that, I had an outfit working in the city for 10 years that equipment: a boring machine,
11614.93|11619.88|a pole truck - pole trailer, and a two-ton truck.
11619.9|11621.44|And they were on so much an hour.
11621.48|11625.5|And in those 10 years, I never raised the rate on that.
11625.54|11627.49|I only raised wages as they went along.
11628.01|11629.65|I took 10% on payroll.
11630.15|11632.13|Well, that was sort of a meal ticket for me.
11632.17|11640.83|And then when they'd get behind, I could leave the work stack up and bring in my men from the field in the fall when they were finished out there.
11641.43|11643.87|And then we'd pick up a lot of extra work in the city.
11644.07|11648.24|I set all the poles in all the suburbs that were built from 1951.
11649.58|11656.63|Yes, I even did some in 1945 or '46.
11657.85|11660.19|And then started again in '50.
11661.81|11667.3|Set all the poles and built all the lines in all the suburbs in Regina.
11667.34|11673.07|That takes in Lakeview, Albert Park, Whitmore Park,
11673.92|11680.19|Douglas Park, Norman, what's the one up northwest?
11680.21|11681.13|Not Normanview.
11682.23|11683.33|Yeah, we did that too.
11683.37|11688.24|We did everything until, as long as it was overhead, we were doing it.
11688.26|11692.44|And once it started going underground, then they started putting their own outfits in.
11694.15|11699.05|And then we were also involved in that through the years, but not in a big way.
11699.11|11700.35|But for 10 years, I
11701.01|11711.56|I had this deal with Nichols, and the superintendent phoned me up one day and asked me what I would take to do some work for them, and I quoted him over the telephone.
11711.96|11714.52|He said, "Put that out in a letter and send it to me."
11715.64|11719.85|And I sent it to him, and about seven years later, he phoned back.
11719.89|11728.18|He said, "Hey, have you got anything, a copy of the deal we made when you started working for the city?"
11728.63|11731.0|I said, "Yeah, I've got the letter in the file here somewhere."
11731.64|11733.38|"Well," he said, "I wish you'd send me a copy of it.
11733.42|11735.2|I can't find my copy of the letter.
11735.26|11738.81|I've been asked some questions regarding your work in here."
11739.43|11745.78|And he said, "I want to show it to him that we had a contract."
11745.8|11749.07|So that was it until it finally petered out gradually.
11751.15|11752.19|And that was it -
11753.64|11757.22|Boy, it was a sort of a mail ticket for me through those ten years.
11757.36|11759.81|I always had that steady work coming in in the city.
11759.85|11765.65|It wasn't big, but it took up the slack, so to speak.
11765.67|11766.49|Steady income.
11768.8|11770.46|And what were some of the other things now?
11770.82|11781.49|I'll have to just think for a moment of other things that may be of interest to you fellows.
11784.32|11794.83|Oh yes, speaking of some of the laws of the game, they always said a business, a company can't stay in business unless they expand.
11796.37|11799.72|Well, we virtually broke that law.
11801.72|11803.58|We never really expanded.
11805.6|11810.55|Well, after the first five years I expanded a bit and then went static from there.
11810.57|11811.91|I had a basic crew.
11813.23|11819.56|I built an office and a shop in '53, and it was too small the day I built it, and it's still operating.
11821.8|11830.05|Now we're up to 35 years later and still getting along with that same shop.
11830.17|11832.08|I did put an extension on the office.
11832.18|11839.05|I expanded the office in 1958, I think it was,
11840.34|11849.09|made some storage room upstairs, and more office space in front which gave us more room in the shop.
11851.32|11857.08|But again, we broke the law that you can't operate -
11858.27|11867.94|Art took over, and I figured right away he's going to have to move into bigger quarters, but up till this day they're still making that same shop do the job.
11868.93|11879.47|I guess the proof in the pudding is the observation of it, that the company has always been sound financially and making money and making things do,
11879.53|11880.49|That's the biggest thing.
11881.05|11884.76|I've seen these shops, you know, with five or six stalls in them.
11884.78|11886.46|The Power Corporation were that way.
11886.9|11890.2|They'd have five or six stalls and everything standing there and nothing happening.
11890.26|11896.55|And when they wanted something overhauled, they'd come down and say, can you get this ready for us tomorrow?
11896.57|11897.33|We've got to have this
11898.23|11900.11|a trenching machine going tomorrow.
11900.13|11906.6|And my fellows would run in the shop and go in maybe and work out on the night and have it going for them.
11906.62|11908.78|And their shop, everything was standing still.
11908.8|11909.98|Well, they were unionized.
11910.0|11917.11|The guy that turned, that cracked the wrench, he couldn't "jack the vehicle up", so to speak.
11919.82|11922.48|Nobody ever knew what it cost them to do their repair work.
11922.56|11924.82|It was so extensive they never even kept track of it.
11927.0|11930.08|That was one of the rules of the game that we built - we wrote.
11930.48|11938.56|So Art and the boys took over, I thought, now they're going to show the old man how to run an outfit.
11938.58|11941.46|Do you know that they never changed one thing?
11941.52|11954.22|The same principles still apply after 21 years that were being used when I was there, excepting
11954.54|11957.24|I had an old man for a bookkeeper.
11959.56|11961.6|When he died, I got another old man.
11963.85|11968.63|And Art got George Jenny's wife.
11968.69|11969.93|She had taken a business course.
11969.95|11972.53|She came in, and she was a crackerjack of a bookkeeper.
11972.55|11974.04|She was worth her weight in gold.
11974.82|11983.24|I said, "If I'd had one like that, maybe I wouldn't have quit business, because she really took a lot of load off in the office."
11984.32|11991.75|And Art put in a, he was always a great guy for gadgets, he put in a second-handed computer that cost him $1,500.
11993.96|11999.28|And he would use it for payroll and for keeping track of accounts, one thing or another.
12000.12|12003.48|And then after that, he got rid of that and he put one in for $10,000.
12003.5|12005.36|And he was using that.
12005.72|12006.75|But I still kid them.
12006.85|12008.53|I said, "Why do you have to have a computer?"
12008.57|12012.69|I said, "I had a man 80 years old making the payroll,
12013.8|12028.9|doing all the books and everything was always up to date he'd be a little late if I asked for a cutoff to see how we were doing." I said, "Sometimes it would take him 30 days to give me a cutoff but I question if they can do it any faster with a computer."
12028.9|12038.2|But Art liked gadgets and he got computers. He even got a small one in his bedroom at home and he does a lot of fiddling around with that.
12038.2|12043.1|He - he was one of the men with more ability than anybody I
12043.99|12070.32|probably ever run across. He could do anything. He could overhaul anything. He could fix anything if they had hydraulic trouble on any machines even the competitors would bring their machines in and have him fix the hydraulics on them which, sometimes when you get a lot of hydraulics on a machine it can become pretty tricky. And weld anything,
12071.38|12081.41|diagnose anything motor troubles or anything like that. He could pick it off just like a real expert.
12081.41|12097.54|And, computer - he could program a computer. He did all his own programming and the computers were most outfits hire a guy to come and do that. Art, he said, "I know what I want" and he would program the computer.
12100.19|12114.89|He said, or claimed that, prices changed so much that unless you had a computer to keep track of it, that you couldn't keep up to it, doing it in longhand.
12116.29|12126.77|That was when you were buying equipment and reselling it, and buying repairs, keeping track of your repairs.
12128.18|12133.21|But I question very much - another girl -
12133.27|12143.02|Of course, if you're going to spend $15,000 for a computer or have to spend that much for another girl, you might as well have a computer and let a computer do the work if you can.
12146.31|12156.24|And that's another thing that in the computer age, I guess you've got to go with it whether you like it or not.
12156.24|12180.24|I get a kick out of when I go down to buy a cup of coffee and to watch what a performance the girl goes through to ring up a 55 cent cup of coffee, and how that machine has to work. And she punches buttons like playing a Hammond organ to ring up a cup of coffee, and I said, "Is all that necessary?" "Well, it's got to go through the computer." she says.
12181.66|12185.78|I suppose they know exactly how much they make on a cup of coffee.
12187.3|12192.53|That could be important if you're selling enough cups.
12192.33|12202.5|Well, now that it's all over, I reminisce in my mind some of the things that happened in the past years.
12202.56|12209.07|I made a lot of friends in the business, a lot of business friends in Regina.
12209.72|12239.61|How fast, now in 20 years or going on to 22 years, it's all disappearing, going over in the horizon. Your friends are dying off, they're moving away, things are, what shall we say, retirement isn't what you imagined it would be. It's all been a different life altogether than I thought it would be. I thought we old-timers that were in the business would be getting together and would have coffee.
12240.55|12245.88|You know that there's not one power man that I have coffee with.
12246.02|12258.65|I have coffee with telephone guys and farmers and bookkeepers and railroaders and everything, but not one of the old power men around here anymore.
12258.71|12263.01|If they are, they don't show up for coffee.
12263.53|12268.7|Oh, once in a while you'll meet one, but not the old pals that I had.
12268.78|12270.24|I think I mentioned earlier that
12270.69|12276.16|my real close friends, Jack Bell, Harold Huntington, and Al Wakemore.
12276.2|12284.51|Harold and Al died long ago, and Jack Bell has moved up to Edmonton.
12284.53|12286.87|So those were my real close friends.
12288.21|12295.82|And many of my other good friends that I had in business. They're down in the area where I am, they've passed on.
12295.88|12297.22|There's not many of them around.
12299.11|12303.79|A fellow called me the other day, that I used to have coffee with regularly.
12303.83|12307.1|I hadn't seen him for, I guess, for 15 years.
12308.82|12311.3|He said, "We've got to get together someday and have coffee."
12311.32|12312.93|I said, "Yeah, a real good idea."
12312.97|12315.75|He had a business right back to back.
12315.85|12320.46|Our business places were back to back for 15 years.
12322.58|12326.81|But it's all changed, all different.
12326.83|12327.97|You have to adjust,
12329.03|12355.61|sort of live from week to week, month to month, and year to year. Change, accept what comes, make the most of it. One thing that I can say is that i've enjoyed relatively good health I haven't been - outside of my operation a year ago, a little over a year ago,
12357.07|12366.06|I've enjoyed relatively good health, considering that when I quit, I - when I quit in 1965, I was pretty well burned out.
12366.14|12370.75|I didn't have any more giddy-up-and-go in me, and that's why I got out of the business.
12370.77|12378.07|I said, "It's just getting too tough to come down here every day and keep this outfit going."
12378.09|12384.48|While I was making good money, I said, "If I don't get out of here, you'll carry me out in a basket."
12385.9|12393.0|I've never regretted that I got out when I did, and I've never regretted -
12393.02|12409.84|In fact, I'm glad that the boys have done well and kept the thing going, and the name Achen is still on the building, and they're still operating under Achen Construction, which to me was one of the highlights, that they thought enough of me to use the name.
12409.9|12413.32|We had a good reputation, and they said,
12414.03|12415.05|"Can we use the name?"
12415.07|12416.13|They asked for permission.
12416.15|12419.19|And I said, "Yes, I'll grant you the permission to use the name that much.
12419.71|12426.44|No strings attached." Except they made it Achen Construction, 1965 Limited.
12427.36|12428.56|They just changed the name.
12428.86|12438.23|An awful lot of people still think I run the company because they see the name, and they never even noticed that the changeover took place.
12439.83|12443.81|And those are some of the
12444.18|12447.61|the good things that come back to you.
12447.63|12463.45|I have to have mentioned that the high praise I have for the men that worked for me, the key men that I kept around there. There were six, eight of them, that they were working for me all the time, and that's what made the company go.
12464.35|12470.54|And this man Miller, while he was an oddball, in some ways, he was
12471.87|12479.92|just ace high as an employee. There wasn't - He was a guy that never said no.
12479.92|12486.93|In the 20 years that we worked together I never raised my voice to him and he never raised his voice to me.
12486.93|12500.99|If we had any discussions they were done in the just in an ordinary tone of voice and and that held no matter how big the difference was or or anything, we'd just talk it over and well
12501.78|12506.1|make a decision, go one way or the other, or go halfway between.
12507.45|12509.47|And that was a wonderful thing.
12511.43|12522.11|Although there were times when I tried to crowd more load onto him, and I had a hell of a time to get him to take over the responsibility of the equipment.
12522.13|12523.91|I'd want a couple of new trucks.
12523.93|12525.71|I'd say, "Go out and buy a couple of new trucks, Art."
12527.12|12528.36|And by God, he'd
12528.64|12531.81|Hum - hum-haw around, hum-haw around, get prices.
12532.05|12534.37|Then he'd come back to me and say, "Which ones should we buy?"
12534.39|12537.59|I said, "Art, I don't give a damn which ones you buy."
12537.67|12539.94|I said, "You're the guy that's going to have to look after them.
12540.02|12542.6|There isn't a hundred dollars difference in the price.
12542.88|12545.88|Get the truck that you want."
12546.27|12549.27|The same with overhauling equipment.
12549.29|12550.85|Boring machines need repairs.
12552.53|12556.22|He'd come in to me and say, "What should we do?"
12556.6|12557.5|"Whatever you think."
12558.01|12564.11|I said, "If you think you want to spend $1,000 fixing that thing up, go ahead and fix it.
12564.13|12566.58|If you want to do it for $500, do it for $500.
12567.22|12569.7|You're the guy who's got to keep it running."
12569.72|12573.16|And eventually he got that he would take the responsibility.
12573.89|12583.86|But that took several years before I could get him to - Well, I suppose he felt he was spending my money and he wanted my permission.
12584.92|12586.44|And after he took over,
12587.47|12590.21|well he had no problem.
12590.29|12594.51|When I went down there, it wasn't to make any decisions.
12595.58|12599.12|It was estimating, to help him estimate.
12599.14|12600.64|And he had done a lot of estimating.
12600.7|12602.5|We used to both estimate a job.
12603.68|12606.23|And I had trained him on estimating.
12606.27|12609.39|And he had his method of doing it, and I had mine.
12610.01|12614.88|And it was amazing how we could estimate a job that would save $50,000 or $100,000 and come out
12615.16|12621.93|with almost the exact figure, but both used a different method of arriving at that figure.
12623.59|12625.76|But he was probably like I was.
12625.78|12637.03|He could multiply man hours, or so many men could do so much work, and you multiply that down to unit prices, how much per unit.
12637.25|12641.86|I'll relate some of the things, though, what experience does for you.
12642.77|12647.51|When he joined up with this fellow from Yorkton, and they were taking on some big jobs.
12650.12|12661.15|They were bidding on a job up in, oh, way up in Alaska - Northwest Territories - north of Whitehorse, wherever Whitehorse is.
12661.17|12670.87|And I had looked at it on a map, a great big map, and saw the route and everything, and talked to Art.
12671.17|12672.37|They went up and looked at it
12673.53|12680.04|and come back, and I talked to him and found out what the terrain was and everything.
12680.08|12688.1|There were three of them, an outfit from Saskatoon, and Art, and this other fellow from Yorkton were going to bid on it jointly.
12696.33|12698.99|And they were up in the hotel doing the estimating, that was it.
12699.07|12701.6|And they had worked on it three days, and they phoned me at the office.
12701.96|12704.67|I was running the office for Art while he was up there.
12704.69|12706.59|Phoned the office, "Come on up for happy hour.
12706.63|12707.27|We're finished."
12707.89|12713.38|So I go up there and I walked in the door. The - the secretary of the outfit, the bookkeeper from Saskatoon.
12713.76|12715.8|He said, "How much you want for building that line, Lindy?"
12716.04|12729.04|And I said, "I would want $1,980,000 to do that job."
12729.06|12730.32|He said, is that complete?
12730.42|12731.18|I said, yeah.
12732.24|12745.55|He said, "My God, he said, we've been sitting here for three days figuring, and you're within $10,000 of what we came up with for a figure."
12747.2|12748.74|He said, "How did you get that figure?"
12748.76|12750.38|I said, "Just dead reckoning."
12750.48|12758.65|I said, "I talked over with Art what the terrain was like and everything, and it was a rough country, and a big job."
12758.65|12760.03|You had to haul the material along -"
12760.91|12761.89|I said, "That's what..."
12762.87|12767.83|Then another time they bid right in the office.
12767.87|12775.74|This fellow from Yorkton and Art would do the job, and they're bidding on stringing a second circuit from Regina to Estevan.
12776.04|12781.57|That's a hundred and, what is it, a hundred and twenty-five or thirty miles.
12783.29|12786.39|One side of the line was hot and you had to string the other side.
12786.41|12787.73|This was on big steel towers.
12788.77|12792.2|And I walked in and this Glen Thorpe guy from Yorkton said,
12792.92|12796.05|"How much for building that line, or stringing that line, Lindy?"
12799.37|12802.07|I said, "$1,250 a tower."
12804.05|12805.02|He looked at me.
12806.0|12808.22|He said, "Cripes, that's just what we figured out.
12808.24|12809.62|We've been sitting here three days."
12812.65|12814.57|"Well," I said, "That's - I figured out.
12814.65|12816.83|I said, What would it take to string that line?
12816.87|12818.07|And that's what I came up with."
12819.61|12822.02|Another time, they were doing a job at Swift Current.
12823.31|12824.65|And it was an odd job.
12824.69|12829.92|It had to be done while the river was froze over, and they had to put three 90-foot poles on an island.
12832.34|12833.79|Oh, it was a hell of a job.
12833.83|12836.71|And I had looked at the blueprint.
12836.73|12840.73|I took a look at that, and I said, "So many men, so many men here."
12842.4|12843.66|I said, "$30,000."
12845.36|12850.31|So this is what I said to myself.
12850.63|12851.55|So when they...
12852.66|12853.68|They had to figure it out.
12853.7|12859.09|I said, "How much you figure for that, that island job?"
12859.29|12860.15|They said $24,000.
12860.55|12862.23|I said, "$30,000."
12862.31|12865.08|Now, you're going to do that job separately.
12865.18|12868.12|Let me know who's the closest when you're finished.
12868.14|12871.67|They never did let me know whether I was right.
12871.93|12875.93|And I have a notion that I was right and they were wrong or that they'd been bringing it up to me.
12877.12|12880.0|Well, those are some of the things you get a big kick out of.
12881.57|12885.37|"Guesstimation", I guess. Guesstimation.
12886.97|12895.29|Another time we had built a line up in Alberta, I may have said that earlier. And Art Miller was up there. This was way back in '49.
12895.29|12909.11|And they couldn't get this line to stay in. It would kick out the fuses as fast they put them in and they had worked - all the engineers from the Canadian Utilities were out there and they couldn't find the trouble. Art phoned me at night
12910.66|12912.52|I said, "I'll tell you what you do in the morning.
12912.54|12917.29|You drive way out to the far end of that line where you cross that big ravine.
12918.39|12920.54|You probably find the wires twisted there."
12922.22|12923.4|He said, "Why do you say that?"
12923.48|12931.74|"Because," I said, "I drove over that line once." And I said, "This would be a beautiful place to have a buck in the wire because you're looking at the trees and you can't see it."
12933.32|12934.86|The next day he phoned at Noon
12934.88|12935.78|and he said, "You were right."
12935.84|12937.47|He said, "The wires were bucked up there."
12937.49|12942.19|He said, "We all looked pretty silly, and then phoned you, and you tell us where the trouble -
12942.21|12946.38|They had driven the line and hadn't seen it, because you looked into the trees, you couldn't see it.
12947.66|12951.64|And when they went back and took a second look at it, they found out that's where the trouble was.
12952.87|12954.91|A lot of times they'd phone in from the country.
12955.55|12958.91|They were up at Elrose, hooking up a town, and they had trouble.
12959.11|12961.34|Funny things were happening to them, and I'm sitting
12961.79|12969.41|at home and they phoned me and "Well," I said, "What's happening?" And they told me. I told them what to look for and they found the trouble and that was it.
12969.41|12980.11|Oh when they had the same thing happen, that was about three years later, the same thing happened but a different foreman, and he couldn't figure out his trouble.
12980.11|12990.45|Then they sort of think you're a wise guy. you know. You come along and a machine isn't working. I come along, the boring machine was in a garage and
12990.86|12995.59|the guy had changed the carburetor, he changed the coils, he did everything, and the motor wouldn't start.
12997.65|13004.32|I said, "Take that switch plate off back here, where you turn the switch on."
13005.38|13007.6|Took it off, the wires were disconnected in there.
13009.26|13011.12|Well - And they all looked at you, you know.
13011.78|13012.6|They'd go, "You're smart.".
13012.62|13014.77|Well, it's just a process of elimination.
13014.81|13018.61|They had tried everything else, but they hadn't tried that, so you tell them to try that.
13020.99|13024.91|Oh, I had a guy, Ray Booth, he used to shake his head.
13024.93|13027.35|He said, "How can you figure these things out?"
13027.37|13029.27|I said, "Process of elimination.
13029.43|13030.5|That's all it is.
13032.8|13039.66|You ask the other guy what he's done first and he's done everything else, then you think of something he hasn't done, that's probably where the trouble is."
13042.19|13051.37|So that's the way it went from - a lifetime in power from 1928 to 1965.
13051.37|13052.79|And then I wasn't finished.
13052.81|13056.29|I still had my finger in the pie till about 1975.
13056.31|13060.66|And since that, not much has...
13060.68|13062.58|They haven't called on me very often.
13062.6|13067.51|They've found out how to... Well, five years ago Art had trouble.
13067.79|13070.19|He couldn't find the trouble.
13070.21|13073.66|It was in a big government garage.
13075.86|13079.77|And again, I told him what to look for, and that's where he found the trouble.
13081.6|13085.45|And I said, "It can't be anything else."
13085.47|13086.91|They were looking in the substation.
13086.97|13089.57|I was looking in the substation and all was right in the building.
13095.4|13097.1|So that's the way it goes.
13100.47|13107.78|I don't know how many more years I'll be here to reminisce, but I'm -
13108.23|13114.56|Every once in a while I get a smile when I think back to some of the things that happened.
13115.24|13132.54|When I started out paying a laborer 40 cents an hour and he paid his own room and board, and now the minimum wage is $3.60 an hour, and you have to pay the room and board, and you pay holiday pay and everything.
13133.32|13137.41|None of that was on the books when I started out.
13139.3|13141.24|You have so many things that have changed.
13143.68|13146.65|And people have become less reliable, too.
13146.79|13155.96|I've found the more money they get, the less they give a damn.
13155.98|13158.68|I don't know what it would be like if I'd be running an outfit now.
13158.74|13163.67|Some of the old-timers tell me, I wish you'd be out here sometime and straighten things out.
13164.61|13168.38|I see what happens around here now compared to what happened when you were there.
13168.93|13179.97|"Well," I said, "I probably wouldn't be able to do much about it. The laws of change and the rules and regulations have changed, and you've got to go along with it.
13183.18|13188.3|So I suppose after you listen to this you may have a lot of questions to ask me.
13188.3|13198.63|To the women, the girls this may not be of much interest, but Danny and Norm should get something out of it. They both worked out on the job."
13199.27|13213.88|Not - not a lot, but enough to get a smattering of what goes on. And, they should get - Not Norm, so much, he - he's in the banking end of it.
13213.88|13220.77|But, Danny should. He's just starting out in life. I was about his age when I started in the power business, and -
13220.77|13227.69|And it doesn't come fast it comes one day at a time, one week at a time, one month at a time ,one year at a time, and
13227.96|13231.22|the main thing is that you're always bettering your own position.
13232.04|13236.13|Use the old saying, day by day, in every way, I'm getting better and better.
13236.99|13240.43|And that will help you as you go along.
13241.5|13248.91|When people see you, that you're the boss of the job, you hardly ever get there overnight.
13248.97|13251.23|That's a long process to get up there.
13253.17|13255.97|I was probably one of the lucky ones.
13257.03|13262.78|And the fact that when I was home, I was put in charge of things from the time I was 19 years old.
13262.84|13267.95|My dad died when I was 21, so I was in full charge of the farm for the three years.
13269.01|13282.25|I worked on power lines, less than two years when I was made a foreman and was never anything less than that throughout my total career. So it -
13285.05|13287.83|It doesn't fall that easy for everyone.
13289.13|13294.54|Some have to work years and years and years to get up the ladder.
13294.56|13305.64|But I can say this, I never went to work in my life when I wasn't anxious to get to the job and meet the challenge of the day, regardless of what it was.
13308.34|13313.05|And with that, I will say, "Over and out."
13315.66|13324.74|Please run this tape to the end so that it will be ready to roll on side three.
