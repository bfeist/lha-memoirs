3.76|6.62|This is May the 3rd, 1986.
8.19|15.39|I'm going to make another attempt at re-taping the years of my life.
16.74|24.99|I've made two or three swings at it now, but invariably something goes wrong had I get nowhere with it.
25.01|33.6|So now I have all the various pieces of tape numbered, and there's going to be about
35.11|64.5|two hours of recording. So as I go along there'll be errors and omissions and there'll be blank spaces etc. but just bear with me and in the long run we'll hope you you'll get a pretty good picture of what L.H.A went through in his 85 years - or going on to 85 years of life. So right now
65.35|74.44|I'm going to start back when I was a boy and we left the state of Iowa.
76.61|85.39|And then from there, just a running story of what I remember, the highlights that I remember.
86.82|94.8|And they're not necessarily in good chronological order, but I think you'll be able to follow the story.
96.67|101.16|Forgive me for all the errors, omissions, etc.
103.28|114.38|So right now we'll turn back and start from about as far back as I can remember.
114.42|117.9|You'll note a great change in voice from time to time.
118.4|125.85|This goes back five or six years from when I first started on this. And,
126.9|131.63|you'll find times when my voice is foggy from cold.
133.35|138.4|Five years older, your voice gets a different pitch to it.
138.42|142.71|So you'll understand what it's all about, I'm sure.
142.73|146.05|So we'll just turn back now and start taping.
160.44|165.23|It would seem that I have the distance about 12 inches from the mic.
165.99|168.81|The voice comes out clearer on the replay.
171.74|175.08|I'm going to do some experimenting.
178.43|180.91|My first experience at speaking into a mic.
182.33|186.96|I'm going to do some experimenting and I've been asked to...
187.56|189.98|I've been asked by my family to give a
190.38|204.78|history of my life and I'll do so and whatever comes out must be it. So, we'll let it go at that.
204.78|216.51|- be a long drawn-out affair as my memory goes back to the year 1907 when
217.35|230.38|I was a small boy of four and a half years old, and we moved up into Canada from Iowa.
230.41|247.17|Whatever possessed my dad to leave that rich farmland down around Sioux City, Iowa, and move up into the frozen, rocky prairies, I will never know. However,
247.72|258.57|he had a family of 12 children, and he seemed to think that if he got up where land was cheap -
259.45|262.96|Prairie was selling at about $20 to $25 an acre.
264.98|267.12|He had the eight sons at the time.
268.1|277.17|The idea was for each one of them to get a quarter section of land and become a farmer, which was a way of life at that time.
288.09|294.95|We landed up at Halbrite the 17th day of March.
299.06|315.51|I don't have any recollection of our arriving at our destination, but I do remember living in a small town hotel for two or three days while they loaded the carloads of -
317.48|323.07|of livestock and machinery.
323.09|333.69|And then I very vividly remember the ride out to the farm which was six miles north of town.
333.71|341.66|That incidentally was the winter of the big snow and there was over three foot of snow on the level throughout the prairies.
343.94|346.65|And I well remember the
348.14|376.45|problem they had keeping the horses on that narrow sway trail, horses that were brought up in a country where there was very little snow. And they would be fighting each other on that narrow track, each one wanted to be sure he didn't slide off the side. To this day I'll never know how we put up in a little
377.34|390.24|house with two bedrooms, a living room and dining room combined, and a kitchen.
391.24|399.61|It would have been something else if you could have a motion picture of how this is all arranged.
399.89|404.07|There were the twelve of us and mother and dad.
408.46|430.69|My next recollection was the snow was all gone, and my dad was building a house a mile from this farm.
430.73|437.42|There was already what you'd call a bachelor's home, 14 by 20,
437.84|438.78|on the place.
440.8|460.18|And he was completing it, putting on a four-bedroom extension, which had a full basement under it, and a large dining room and living room.
460.2|467.79|From there on, I don't remember too much until I started school.
471.81|477.03|We had three miles to go to school.
478.71|484.98|And of course there was always a buggy load or a sleigh load, whichever.
487.97|494.34|And I was one of the younger ones, so I didn't have to worry about transportation.
496.78|512.12|Until I became about eight or nine years old, and then as the farm was expanding, they needed the horses to work on the land, so we would walk to school.
512.14|518.23|At that time, well, we'd cut across the field, and we could make a walk in two miles.
518.77|520.48|No road, just through the fields.
526.28|537.41|I think it was about six or seven years later, they moved the school a half mile, which put it on the main road.
540.94|553.87|And it was there that I finished my education, which took me through grade six and into
554.42|561.13|about six weeks in grade seven when the teacher and I had a fallout.
562.13|571.96|And between my mother and I, we decided that it was just as well if I stayed home and helped with the chores.
572.04|580.23|And as a sideline, I started a trap line, which
585.31|599.64|consisted of trappings, coyotes, skunks, and weasels.
599.66|605.27|And - further in the history of my life - I think where I wound up, I was -
605.29|613.7|I had just left school and decided to stay home and start a trap line.
613.78|614.52|From there on,
615.5|618.02|life was quite ordinary.
618.04|618.62|Stayed home.
620.2|624.02|Did chores, finished the chores about 10 o'clock in the morning.
624.04|626.19|Jump on a horse, ride my tramp line.
629.21|633.87|Come back home early afternoon in time to start chores again.
633.89|635.94|And every day was pretty repetitious.
635.96|644.52|Once in a while in the evening if the weather was good, you'd jump on a horse and ride it six and a half miles and do some skating.
645.94|648.48|Maybe get home by 10:30 or 11 o'clock.
650.14|651.76|Away you go the next day.
651.78|658.61|Finally, besides trapping, I found out there was quite a few furs in the country.
659.11|664.06|And I found a place in St. Louis that was paying exceptionally good prices.
664.24|674.29|So I started nosing around to find out what the other fellows were getting for their coyotes and skunks and weasels.
675.25|679.15|And I found that I was getting pretty near twice as much by shipping to St. Louis.
680.36|685.28|So I picked up a partner, a neighbor boy, and we started scouting around.
685.3|693.01|And we went into a fellow that had wolfhounds, and he had, I think it was 11 coyote pelts.
693.93|696.23|But they were in one heck of a shape.
696.25|702.54|They're all bloody and tore up from the wolfhounds killing them.
704.41|709.04|And when we went there, the fellow said he wanted $10 apiece.
710.48|712.68|That would have been about $100 worth.
712.76|716.97|And when the dust settled, we flashed a little money around there, and he was pretty hard up.
716.99|722.93|When the dust settled, we come away with, I think it was eight hides for $36.
725.04|727.92|We shipped them away, and the first hide we shipped away.
727.94|729.78|It was a good pelt.
729.86|732.63|We cleaned it up, couldn't send it away, and we got $30 for it.
732.96|736.43|So we had the rest pretty much for profit.
738.11|741.47|Well, then I sort of went on my own after that.
741.49|746.02|I picked up wherever I could, weasels and skunks.
746.04|752.87|In one case, I bought 40-some skunk hides at one place.
752.97|754.25|Didn't make big money.
754.27|758.09|Maybe made $2 a piece on them or something like that.
760.42|761.92|And that was the end of that.
761.96|777.32|That only lasted one year and then people found out where I was shipping my furs and they went ahead and shipped them on their own.
777.34|789.55|That would take us through the years of about 1916, '17, I'd say, somewhere in there.
791.05|793.11|Yeah, '16 and '17.
793.13|800.38|I think it was the winter of '16 when J.P. was married.
800.4|805.87|I remember Joe and Zip and I were out getting a load of feed.
807.61|814.14|When they were driving by in the bobsleigh from the Orstead place, they were going down to catch the train into Weyburn.
814.16|816.22|They were going into Weyburn to get married.
816.22|816.99|That was winter of quite a big snow, and
819.04|820.98|coming spring we had big floods.
821.87|826.15|It was just unbelievable the amount of runoff that was around the place.
826.17|827.87|That I remember very distinctly.
827.89|836.34|We had one granary that was in a kind of a little spot in the water, about three, four feet on it, and all of the grain got soaked.
836.36|845.47|We had to - When the snow ran away and it dried up and we couldn't get at it, we had to scatter it in several different
846.41|856.21|bins and floors where we could keep turning it over every day and try to preserve it for feed.
856.25|866.94|Around about that time went fast, 1917, 1917, that was the year, no 1918 was when the flu hit.
866.96|869.21|No, fall of' 17 is when it hit bad.
869.61|872.35|People were dropping dead left and right all over the place.
872.37|876.01|It didn't hit our place until the spring of '18.
877.21|887.9|And I remember very well when it hit our place one Sunday afternoon, Leona and Mac and I all took sick about the same time.
889.0|893.59|And when it was time to go for the cows, I asked Mac if I wasn't feeling good,
893.67|894.67|I asked him if he was would go,
894.69|895.15|and he started crying,
895.17|896.09|he said he was sick.
897.1|901.04|So I got on the old black riding mare and went.
901.06|903.06|I had to go a mile over to where the cattle were.
903.08|904.24|They were just running at large.
904.92|906.33|And picked them up.
906.35|907.05|And,
909.12|911.66|on the way home, I was delirious.
911.75|914.37|I can remember hanging on to the mane.
914.39|919.68|The old lady, the mare, she knew enough to bring the cattle in, and I hung on to the mane so that I wouldn't fall off.
921.0|922.66|And we were milking the cows that night -
922.68|925.42|None of us knew what was wrong with us.
925.45|931.41|Then Milt and I were milking the cows, and I can remember falling off the stool, you know.
932.22|935.82|You were half delirious and didn't know, just like a drunken man.
936.8|943.7|However, the result was that we were all down with the flu then, the next day.
943.72|947.91|Everybody excepting Dad, he was the only one that it didn't hit.
947.93|955.12|All the rest of use - now you would say, "confined to our beds" for three, four days and really sick with high temperature.
955.14|965.57|Fortunately, there wasn't anybody in our neighborhood that died from it, but there were an awful lot of people around the country - It hit pregnant women particularly hard.
966.38|974.83|They were, you know, had about a 50-50 chance of living if they were going to have a baby.
974.85|979.94|And that's all it takes through '17, 1918, still home on the farm.
979.96|983.88|Well, that spring, Dad bought a brand new tractor, a brand new Titan tractor.
983.9|987.67|That was the big thing in that part of the country.
988.61|991.47|At that time, tractors were just something brand new.
993.07|1001.12|I remember a showpiece that was, and everybody there on Sunday, the people would flock in to see that brand new tractor.
1001.14|1008.55|By today's standards, it was just about as useless as a - anything could be to do field work with it.
1008.57|1017.36|You're only travelling about two and three-quarters of a mile an hour in high gear, so you could figure out how ... you could accomplish in one day.
1017.38|1023.06|It would only pull about as much as five horses, I'd say.
1023.7|1026.77|About equivalent to a five-horse load.
1028.89|1033.16|That was '18, and '19 we dried out, totally dried out.
1033.18|1044.49|We didn't - we just had to scrape and scrounge around to get enough feed to keep our livestock going for the winter, and enough grain possibly for the seed for the next year.
1045.06|1050.92|But somehow it seemed we got by. No handouts from the government.
1051.12|1062.04|With my dad, there were about five sets of relief from the government at any time throughout the years that we were farming.
1062.36|1070.99|In 1920, the grasshoppers came in, and they just really come in clouds, you know, ... poison a whole quarter section.
1071.61|1080.52|Mixed the poison - Well, they were doing it at the municipal headquarters, and we'd pick it up in bags, and then you'd put it on gloves, and
1081.13|1091.48|it was arsenic in with molasses and saw dust. And you'd walk through the fields and scatter that around to poison the hoppers.
1091.48|1105.79|But in the end, you got very little crop out of it. It was probably five bushel to the acre so and that took us through '20. '21, a good crop a good crop that could ...
1106.78|1114.03|And then it was the fall of '21. Dad bought a little separator to go with the little Titan tractor we had.
1115.29|1122.7|In the course of rigging it up, he and Joe and Zip got into some kind of an argument, so he appointed me to operate the machine.
1122.72|1125.54|I was 19 years old at that time.
1125.66|1132.63|So I was the chief operator of the separator and the engine, run both ends of it.
1134.89|1141.72|... back to many other things besides that, to keep the grain wagons there and whatnot.
1141.74|1146.11|And as it was then, that was '21. Then that fall, Joe left. He went to the coast.
1146.43|1148.71|In the winter, Zip left and went to the coast.
1148.73|1153.74|So Mac and I were home alone on the farm then through '21, '22.
1153.92|1159.85|Well, Bud was starting to grow up big enough then to be of a little help.
1159.87|1161.37|He was born in 1911.
1162.55|1167.82|And so he could herd in cows for us, or one thing or another.
1167.84|1170.4|And in '23, we were having good crops,
1170.42|1171.92|'22, '23.
1174.22|1180.13|And it was just work work work all the time.
1180.19|1183.06|That's all you ever did.
1183.08|1183.96|You played a little bit.
1184.62|1189.16|You went to a country dance once in a while, a schoolhouse dance or so, maybe once a month.
1189.52|1197.09|Other than that, you'd just work, stay at home, read by the oil lamp, go to the neighbors maybe once a week and have a card game.
1198.31|1205.1|And time went fast, you worked hard, you were tired when night come, you were satisfied to bed and call it a day.
1207.36|1212.39|And the winter of twenty - the fall of '23, mother went to California.
1212.41|1214.19|She and Leona went to California.
1215.17|1218.37|And it was during that winter-
1218.41|1219.89|That was almost an open winter.
1219.91|1222.57|Dad and I were hauling grain with wagons.
1222.59|1224.06|We were not using sleighs.
1225.22|1227.28|Right through the winter, we used wagons.
1227.3|1232.94|And I used to go out and load up two loads of grain after the chores were done, and we'd go to town.
1233.42|1236.57|And back was six miles.
1236.59|1239.13|You walked your team the whole way down and the whole way back.
1239.21|1243.33|So it's a big half day to go downtown and back.
1244.21|1248.23|He kept complaining he wasn't feeling good all the while we were hauling grain.
1249.27|1251.58|Finally, one day he goes to the doctor at Griffin.
1251.6|1255.82|The doctor told him he's just an old, burned-out piece of machinery.
1255.84|1262.19|And so he didn't feel any better, so he got on the train one day and went down to Kenmare, North Dakota.
1262.21|1264.17|There were some doctors there.
1264.19|1268.72|The Ewing brothers had quite a reputation as being good doctors.
1270.16|1274.05|So he went down there to see what was wrong with him.
1274.72|1278.78|And when I put him on the train that day, that was the last time I talked to Dad.
1280.16|1285.09|The next word we got within about a week's time that he'd been admitted to the hospital.
1285.11|1289.81|And the very next day we got a phone call, somebody better come down, your dad was seriously ill.
1292.14|1299.0|So that night I - that afternoon I went to town, didn't have any money or anything to go with and,
1299.56|1302.86|I went to the banker and told him what had happened.
1302.88|1307.87|He was a good friend of Dad's, so he said, "Here's the money, whatever you need, you can have."
1307.89|1321.45|And we went to ... that night and caught the train and got into Kenmare at about 2 o'clock in the morning after a big layover at that portal, at the international border.
1322.41|1327.07|Got there about 2 o'clock in the morning, I phoned in the hospital, and they said, "Dad is resting well."
1328.08|1340.69|And the next morning, when I walked down to see him, which was about 9 o'clock in the morning when I got to the hospital, they said, "Your daddy has died."
1340.71|1344.82|So that was another paragraph finished.
1344.84|1350.61|From there on, I got back to the hotel, and I phoned my aunt back at Halbrite to find out
1350.92|1352.05|Where do I start?
1352.07|1352.67|What do I do?
1352.69|1358.72|And she directed me and got busy on the phone and notified everybody.
1358.74|1368.67|I'll cut it off now and we'll come to that story when we start up again about what happened to Dad ...
1371.08|1377.43|And what I did - here I am, twenth - what was it - 21 years old.
1377.45|1378.79|21 the fall before
1379.65|1381.69|with a thing like this in ...
1381.73|1389.99|My mother was in - by this time she'd gone up to my sister, Emma was in Oregon, and she was visiting there.
1389.99|1404.15|Leona had stayed in California, so we got ahold of her, and it's a long story from there on, and so we're cutting her off for now, and I'll finish that when I start up again.
1404.17|1408.54|Well, here we are, about three weeks later,
1409.36|1413.33|And I'll try to carry on from here.
1414.99|1424.85|First off, I'll turn the clock back and sort of reminisce on some of the highlights.
1424.87|1436.48|Some of the things that I remember that were outstanding during that first, what was that, 22 years that I've come to now.
1437.99|1444.5|First, I distinctly remember coming to Halbrite when I was four and a half years old.
1447.34|1450.35|Nothing much happened then through the years.
1450.37|1452.91|I don't think I started school until I was about seven.
1456.55|1465.44|When I was about eight years old, I went to the States with my mother and dad, went down by train in the winter to  -fall, I guess it was, yes, in the fall of the year.
1466.52|1468.12|And I remember
1469.27|1494.26|seeing a team of horses run away and run in front of our train and a man and lady sitting up high on the wagon and I was looking out of the window and I saw the train hit them and there's pieces through every direction and the woman got run over and I can distinctly remember looking down out of the window and seeing one of her legs lay along the track.
1494.264|1501.14|The horses didn't get hurt. They went - run away wild, over the field.
1501.14|1507.4|Then we visited through Iowa, and I remember a few things about that visit.
1507.4|1519.51|And then mother stayed down in Iowa and Dad came home with me. And we stopped in Minneapolis, and I still remember him taking me to the bar room that night while he went in to have a drink,
1519.51|1523.88| and of all the food they had in their - free food. You could have anything you wanted.
1523.88|1531.42|Homemade sausage and bread and butter or anything like that.
1531.44|1537.73|I don't remember any more about the trip excepting those three little incidents.
1539.73|1545.04|Back when I was 11 years old, I went to the convent that winter.
1545.06|1554.27|I went there about the first of November and stayed there until Easter time, when I came home and finished my schooling.
1554.96|1561.49|I was taking my grade five, I think.
1562.23|1567.75|I can remember I couldn't write very good, anyway.
1568.88|1572.76|And then I remember the World War coming on.
1572.92|1574.32|You didn't hear much about it.
1574.34|1580.83|No radio, no communication, except when Dad would come home from town with the news about what was going on.
1580.85|1584.51|He would bring a paper home.
1587.23|1594.58|I heard my first radio, I think it was 1921.
1594.72|1603.43|Maybe later than that, it could have been '22 or '23, I heard my first radio.
1603.45|1617.15|In the winter of '22, I came to Regina and took a telephone course in order to be able to maintain the telephones at home, the local rural telephone.
1621.12|1626.49|Life wasn't a happy thing for me at the time, I recollect.
1626.51|1628.21|I didn't care about dancing.
1628.23|1631.65|I used to go to the dances, but dancing didn't mean anything to me.
1631.67|1634.52|There was no drinking amongst the young people, whatever.
1634.54|1639.77|House parties were quite common, and you had a lot of fun at house parties.
1639.83|1644.43|I played games that anyone from six to sixty could play.
1644.55|1649.26|And hunting and working, that was the main interest you had.
1649.28|1651.2|In the summertime, I played baseball.
1651.22|1652.72|I always loved the game of baseball.
1653.85|1666.49|I thought nothing of riding six miles a night after supper to practice baseball, let alone play.
1666.51|1668.33|Another great interest was wrestling.
1668.59|1671.13|I was fairly good at wrestling.
1671.15|1676.46|I wasn't in any way a professional, but I learned a lot about it.
1676.48|1681.53|A great thing that carried you a long way is what the best means of self-defense, it was.
1681.36|1688.27|And you didn't fear anybody because once you got in and got ahold of him, well, you were just as good as he was.
1688.54|1698.97|And I demonstrated many times in the years to come that I knew more than just an average wrestler.
1698.99|1706.58|Many, many unusual stories turned up out of that.
1706.6|1713.55|Right now, I'll go back now to about 1924, yes.
1713.75|1715.53|Dad was dead and buried.
1716.41|1717.34|Big funeral;
1717.87|1719.81|rainy day; drove to town;
1720.28|1728.1|his body was brought out to the farm and laid in state there, you might say, for a couple of days until the funeral day.
1729.01|1737.91|And it was raining, cars weren't running, everybody drove in with teams, six and a half miles to town.
1737.93|1744.8|So it was anything but a nice funeral day. And the only -
1744.86|1746.98|And it started snowing.
1747.54|1752.2|Just when the mass was just about over it starts and it snowed quite heavy.
1752.2|1778.33|And I remember, always remember one of the things that the station agent T.P McGee, said to me the next day, he said, "Well Linden," he said, "Happy is the day" - no, "Happy is the day -" "Happy is the soul that the snow falls on."
1778.33|1784.26|The snow had fallen. He meant "that the rain falls on." Snow and rain had fallen -
1786.62|1804.63|Right now I'll add a few words while I'm trying to get the tapes lined up again.
1804.63|1814.59|This is something to try to make a continuous story out of these bits and pieces so now I'll start the tape rolling again.
1818.06|1833.82|I'm still having trouble.
1835.62|1838.88|I'm still having trouble, but I'll get 'er in time sooner or later.
1845.17|1847.21|You'll hear some repeating in the background.
1848.02|1853.06|So I took the reins of running the farm at that particular moment right then.
1853.06|1860.01|Everybody went their way and Mac and I and Bud and Mother were left alone on the farm.
1860.03|1860.83|And I went about about things.
1861.05|1864.05|I knew all about farming.
1864.07|1865.55|Carried on just the same as when Dad was there.
1865.57|1872.34|I had to look after all the finances and take care of the bank accounts and everything.
1872.36|1874.56|Decide where we planted and what we planted.
1875.18|1877.67|But not - Mac and I got along very good.
1877.69|1879.49|We run a good show here.
1880.13|1891.59|At the end of the three years, the banker said that we had run one of the best financial farms in the district.
1891.61|1893.27|Not big, but it was good.
1893.29|1896.03|We made good money each year.
1896.05|1903.62|And for my efforts, I got $600 the first year, $800 the second year,
1904.53|1907.81|$1,000 the third year.
1907.81|1926.2|And it was at that time when some of the boys came home from california and they - things hadn't been going too well down there. I expect. And, they started you know, sort of raising the dickens that I was getting too much money. I had the use of the car as well.
1926.2|1931.54|Naturally, being the manager of the farm I just ride the tractor and let the other guys sit around.
1931.94|1935.9|Well, ... machinery and let the other boys sit around.
1935.92|1938.12|I was the manager and took charge.
1938.14|1943.05|If there was anybody that wasn't on the machine, it was me.
1943.07|1954.15|So I got my Irish up and I said, "Okay, if that's the way you feel about it, somebody else can run the farm.
1954.17|1958.4|I can make a living without staying here and getting
1958.99|1960.05|too much money."
1960.09|1965.09|My wages already had been set for $1,200 for the next year.
1965.11|1978.93|So with that, I threw in the towel, and I packed up my suitcase, and a cousin from Worthington, Iowa, by the name of Norbert Hemmer, was up harvesting with us.
1978.95|1986.94|And I jumped in the car - in the car with him, and we drove straight through to Worthington, Iowa, which is about 1,300 miles.
1986.94|1991.2|And I'll never forget the trip, late in November and
1991.2|1993.54|oh, there was snow all over the country.
1993.56|1998.67|There had been snow pretty near all the way down there.
1998.71|1999.25|It was cold.
1999.27|2003.92|We just had a Ford Roadster, Model T Ford Roadster.
2003.94|2009.43|And when I got there, I think we had 36 hours on the road.
2009.45|2012.08|When I got there, I had chilblains so bad that I went to the doctor with them. And he said, "This get in time, will heal up, take care of itself."
2020.08|2025.25|So, anyway, I stayed with an uncle in Worthington, Iowa.
2025.27|2034.36|I had been down there on previous visits, so I wasn't a stranger in the area.
2034.5|2035.34|I knew all my relatives.
2035.5|2038.45|I stayed at Uncle Nick's place, and I got there.
2038.47|2039.18|And, you know, I was sort of disturbed and upset.
2039.18|2042.06|I was out of my environment in which I was so happy.
2043.54|2045.97|So I got so I couldn't go to sleep at night.
2046.312|2049.86|I'd go to bed, and I'd lay awake until 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.
2049.86|2060.03|I went to the doctor about it. He said, "Before you go to bed at night, you go out and take a good walk of two or three miles." He said, "And when you get to bed you'll go to sleep."
2060.03|2063.89|So, I did this and it seemed to work out very well.
2064.22|2071.35|Well, I stayed in Worthington during December, doing nothing, just hanging around.
2071.37|2078.35|I forget how much money I had, but I had wages coming from home.
2078.6|2090.21|I had enough money that I was able to buy a Model T Coupe, a car, on the pay, as they called it.
2090.23|2090.85|And with that,
2091.57|2093.83|I was lurking around the town -
2093.85|2096.98|Worthington was about 300 people.
2097.0|2101.26|And I wasn't doing ... welfare, there were a lot of people around there not working.
2101.28|2105.75|Cousin Jake Achen was down there at the time, too.
2105.77|2109.61|And in the course of being with Jake, I got to the blacksmith shop one day.
2109.63|2112.19|And his cousin run the blacksmith shop.
2112.21|2113.07|And it started raining.
2113.21|2114.57|It got sleety as it could.
2114.59|2116.9|It was just a sheet of ice all over.
2116.92|2119.86|And everybody was bringing in horses to shoe. So,
2120.82|2125.84|he asked if anybody wanted help him, and I said, "Sure, I can trim the horse's hoof as well as anybody."
2125.95|2132.16|So I started trimming the horse's hoof, and he would fit on the shoes, and pretty soon he had me nailing on the shoes.
2132.18|2134.14|For that, he was paying me four dollars a day.
2134.36|2137.99|I probably worked there about a week or ten days.
2138.07|2141.57|Oh, I'd say a week at the outside, and that was over.
2142.29|2146.1|And then I was around town, and I think it was on the fourth or fifth day of January, there was a power gang working in
2148.74|2152.23|Worthington or working out of Worthington.
2152.25|2154.41|And one of the girls at the cafe tipped me off.
2154.95|2159.54|She said, "Hey, if you want a job, one of the guys on the power gang is going to get fired.
2159.56|2163.51|I heard the boss say to another man, he's going to fire him tonight."
2163.53|2165.53|So I went to the boss and I said, "Can I get a job?"
2165.55|2166.59|And he said, "Sure."
2166.61|2169.2|He said, "Come around tomorrow morning and go to work.
2170.2|2174.22|Wages would be 35 cents an hour."
2174.24|2175.44|Well, ...
2176.17|2178.79|Ten hours a day, $3.50 a day.
2178.97|2180.33|Hooray, away we go!
2181.15|2185.9|And I went to work the next morning, and that was my start.
2186.76|2192.44|This was on January the 4th, 1927.
2192.44|2192.6|I'll always remember that date.
2200.59|2211.48|My first day was digging holes. The ground was froze anywhere from, well from 6 inches to 2 1/2 feet.
2211.48|2212.32|two and a half feet.
2212.03|2216.95|And I was being the new man on the gang - I think there were five men on the gang -
2216.97|2219.87|I being the new man, I got the last tools around.
2220.01|2226.16|I got ahold of a bar for digging through frost that was just so dull.
2226.18|2230.64|And I went out and I thought that at the end of the first day that my hands would break.
2230.64|2234.04|You know, I was ambitious and I worked hard, but I wasn't making any headway.
2234.06|2244.46|The second day, one of the older fellows on the crew looked at the bar and he said, "You can't dig with a bar like that." He said, "I'll get you a sharp one tonight."
2244.46|2251.66|So he got me a sharp bar. The third day I was able to dig as many holes as anybody on the gang.
2252.03|2259.25|And the fourth day I dug more holes than anybody there, and never looked back from there on in.
2259.27|2260.97|I was the top production man.
2261.93|2264.33|Being younger than the other men, and powerful,
2264.43|2267.92|I was able to just produce more than they could.
2268.52|2277.75|Well, we, I don't remember, I was on that job maybe a month.
2277.77|2282.65|We were moving around the country, not necessarily always in Worthington.
2282.67|2284.9|And the boss come along one day and
2285.28|2291.73|he said, "We're moving out of here, we're moving across the state to Sioux City, to south of Sioux City, Iowa.
2292.57|2296.1|Do you want to go along with us?"
2296.12|2297.16|Well, I'll have to relate.
2297.18|2308.13|In the meantime, the boss had come to me one day, and he said, "Say, he said, I put in for 40 cents an hour for you, but the head office turned it down.
2309.4|2317.09|I see that you're doing more work than any of these other fellows, but you -" He said, "But you didn't have seniority so they wouldn't pass it."
2317.09|2321.84|"So," he said, "I'm going to plug your time enough so that it will amount to 40 cents an hour."
2321.84|2326.74|Well, I felt pretty happy about that.
2326.76|2329.07|Well, to get back, he said, "We're moving across the state."
2329.91|2332.53|He said, "Do you want to go with us?"
2332.55|2339.05|I said, "Yes, but I don't think I should have to keep on building holes anymore."
2339.058|2345.7|I said, "I can build more holes than anybody you've got around here and I kind of think it's time I learn to do something else."
2347.7|2352.71|"Well," he said, "You won't have to be close very much when you get over there."
2352.73|2353.59|He said, "I'll teach you other things."
2355.35|2365.8|So we moved across to a town by the name of Winnebago, Nebraska, just south of Sioux City, Iowa.
2365.82|2370.14|And we were there for - into the spring break up.
2370.26|2373.0|And one Sunday afternoon, I took a notion to drive up to Fulton, South Dakota
2375.72|2382.47|to my brother, Lorry's farm, which was about 125 miles from where I was working.
2384.67|2390.84|And I drove up there, and here I find Lorry in one heck of a mess.
2390.86|2396.56|His wife had died what, two years before that.
2396.58|2398.86|And he had eight children.
2398.88|2400.15|Oh, seven.
2400.17|2401.37|One had died.
2401.71|2402.75|He had seven children.
2402.77|2404.61|The oldest one about 17, a girl of 17,
2405.18|2410.87|couple of boys at about 10 and 11 years old.
2410.89|2415.69|And he had sciatica so bad he could hardly walk.
2415.81|2421.08|So when I saw the shape he was in, I said, "Well, I'll quit my job and I'll come up here and I'll put your crop in."
2421.1|2423.46|The man was actually sick, worried sick.
2423.98|2425.85|He didn't know how he was going to carry on.
2425.87|2428.21|He didn't have any money.
2428.23|2430.81|And things were really breaking bad for him.
2430.83|2432.39|So he said, "I'll come back up here.
2432.41|2438.50|I'll go down and work till the end of the month and then I'll come up and put in your crop for you."
2438.50|2444.15|So I, when I was leaving, he said, "Have you got enough money now to get down, down home?"
2444.27|2445.89|Oh, I said, "Yeah, I'm all right.
2445.91|2446.85|I got $3.
2447.07|2448.93|I got my tank full of gas.
2449.01|2449.83|That'll get me there."
2450.63|2454.36|"Well," he said, "What are you going to do if you have a flat tire?"
2454.38|2456.64|"Well," I said, "I don't expect to have a flat tire."
2457.3|2459.08|So he handed me a $10 bill.
2459.12|2460.52|He said, "Here, take this."
2460.54|2464.51|He said, "Just in case you have trouble."
2464.53|2465.37|So I went down there.
2465.39|2466.07|I -
2466.84|2471.55|I told the boss the next day what I had run into, and I said, "I'm going to quit at the end of the week."
2472.83|2476.49|And I said, "Anyway, I don't like this life too much."
2476.51|2479.92|I said, "You're leading a kind of a transient life."
2479.94|2486.62|And I said, "I was brought up in a good home, where you had, you know, everything you needed to live with your parents that was just -
2490.83|2494.57|get by with what we have to have in a good home."
2495.72|2497.66|Well, he said, "I'll tell you something.
2497.68|2499.4|You'll leave now, but you'll be back."
2500.88|2506.09|He said, "You're the kind of an individual that I can see really likes this kind of life."
2508.15|2511.03|"No, " I said, "I'll never come back."
2511.05|2517.1|So, with that, at the end of the week, I said "Goodbye," and I went up to Lorry's.
2517.12|2533.22|I spent April, May, June, and until about the middle of July, and really got his operation off of the ground and really going good.
2538.91|2547.16|Woke up one - or didn't wake up one afternoon - but here one afternoon a cloud comes along, the hail come through and we were just ready to -
2550.48|2552.62|Just now the tape cut off.
2553.88|2564.06|And I can't just tell where it's going to start in, because when I go in on the tape, I find out I start talking about something else.
2564.08|2566.65|So I'll finish this story off.
2567.17|2576.62|Lorry didn't know what to do, so I got some of the neighbors in, and we cut his 40 or 50 acres of oats was just flat on the ground.
2576.69|2578.51|We put it up into stacks.
2579.38|2580.72|And that took us a few days.
2580.74|2588.51|And when that was finished, I went into south, into Nebraska, where I had a cousin that was farming.
2588.53|2594.5|And I helped them with the harvest, and that's where I found out what real heat is.
2595.6|2597.83|It's never been hot for me any place since.
2599.87|2601.67|There, it never cooled off at night.
2601.71|2606.86|It just stayed about 90, 92 degrees day and night.
2607.97|2619.41|I help them with their harvest and then I head it north and I think somewhere along here we'll cut back in and I'll pick up when I head back up into Dakota.
2620.53|2625.94|So right now I'll turn the other tape on and see what comes out of it.
2627.82|2629.55|We'll try to patch it up.
2629.55|2631.11|- visit Janie.
2631.12|2635.29|Janie had a new baby, her first.
2635.42|2642.15|So from there, after spending ten days there, she's going on to London, England to visit Norm.
2644.33|2664.45|So I've been here on my own getting along okay, sort of preparing for winter, doing up the swimming pool and taking the flowers out as they die and whatnot, cut down a couple of big trees in front, just generally preparing for winter.
2664.72|2694.02|<music> That bit of music you heard in there was I'm taping over a record that I had taken off the radio the other day they were playing the song yes we have no bananas and I sing that to Janie or to little Leslie every once in a while so I just want to let her know that it was really a
2694.23|2696.36|a song that I hadn't just made it up.
2697.94|2709.83|However, to get back to when I left Lorry's, I think that's where I stopped on the other side of the tape.
2709.85|2713.43|While I was in Iowa, I met my cousin.
2713.45|2718.66|She was a Hemmer girl, married to a Deaner, lived in Nebraska.
2718.68|2721.32|And they had asked if I'd come out there and help them harvest.
2723.21|2726.59|So when we were hailed out at Lorry's, I helped him a few days.
2726.75|2735.2|We cut up, cut down a field of green oats that had been badly pounded, and we put it up for hay.
2736.46|2744.45|And after that was finished, I got in my car and I went down to Deaner's at Davis City, Nebraska to help them harvest.
2744.47|2747.26|Well, while down there, I found out what heat was.
2747.28|2749.74|To me, it's never been hot since that.
2750.33|2752.81|I guess it was in August of 1927.
2752.93|2756.55|It would be so hot there.
2757.84|2760.5|And the harvest went on as usual.
2760.52|2763.3|We didn't stop because it was too hot.
2764.08|2766.23|But there was no breeze night or day.
2766.71|2768.37|The wind mill would just dance there.
2768.41|2772.44|Maybe by two o'clock in the morning the window would start to turn a little bit.
2773.66|2777.26|You'd go to bed at night and you'd just lie on the cover
2777.63|2786.14|on the bed without any covers no clothes on and perspire. And if you got three hours sleep in a night you were darn lucky.
2786.14|2803.40|And this - well I suppose it lasted for about a week that it was real bad, but it was a brand new experience for me after having gone through so many harvests up here in canada it's reasonably cool all the time.
2803.40|2824.63|After I finished there, I got in the car and I went up through by Lorry's place again, stopped there a couple of days, and then on up to Aberdeen, South Dakota, where I had an uncle and a cousin that - Irvine, the oldest boy was just my age.
2824.65|2826.85|I had met him in Iowa.
2826.87|2830.63|So I went off to their farm.
2831.08|2832.82|I didn't know where I was going.
2832.88|2835.7|I was just out scouting around.
2836.2|2844.11|So I went out there and found that they were in the process of haying, right in the start of harvesting, haying.
2844.13|2852.2|So I helped them a bit for a few days, and I told them that I'd like to give a job welding a thrashing machine, because I was an experienced separator operator.
2854.6|2862.83|And they told me, "Well, there's a fellow out north of town with the greatest thrasher in this country.
2862.85|2865.13|He's had a reputation for years and years."
2862.85|2865.13|He's had a reputation for years and years."
2866.07|2867.85|"Well," I said, "I'll go out and see him."
2868.09|2870.38|I had the courage and the nerve.
2870.4|2873.72|I was self-confident.
2873.74|2878.0|So I stopped at a service station to gas up before I went out there.
2878.03|2880.95|And the fellow noticed I had an Iowa license on me.
2881.05|2882.23|He asked me what I was doing.
2882.27|2884.43|I said, "Well, I'm harvesting."
2884.45|2886.89|He said, "Where are you harvesting?"
2886.91|2892.12|"Well," I said, "I'm going to go out and see if I can get a job running a Martin Twight Separator."
2892.14|2893.56|"Martin Twight Separator?!"
2893.96|2894.76|I said, "Yes."
2896.18|2898.48|"Well, he's the best flasher in the country.
2899.02|2900.04|They never stop.
2900.16|2904.65|Once that machine starts in the morning, it never stops till night."
2904.67|2907.07|"Well," I said, "That's the kind of an outfit I want to work on.
2907.19|2908.85|I used to run one like that.
2908.93|2909.73|We never stopped." I said,
2909.79|2911.23|"From morning 'til night.
2911.25|2913.86|We bet that we wouldn't have any trouble during the day."
2914.58|2922.07|However, I went up there, and when I got to Martin Twight's, Scandinavian fellow,
2923.11|2924.69|Well, he said, "It's too bad."
2924.71|2926.09|He said, "You didn't come sooner.
2926.11|2929.34|I just hired a fellow for yesterday."
2930.22|2938.25|And, then he said, "I'll tell you what, we're going to make a trial run here on Saturday - we've overhauled the machine.
2938.27|2940.32|And we're going to make a trial run on Saturday.
2940.34|2945.3|So you come on back over on Saturday and we'll just see how things go."
2946.28|2950.16|Well, as it was, I got there on Saturday, and the other fellow didn't show up.
2950.19|2951.83|So we harnessed up the machine.
2951.87|2957.4|When you say harnessed up the machine, that means putting all the belts on and getting it all ready to operate.
2958.92|2965.47|And we got our all belted up in the steam engine, hooked onto it, and we started thrashing.
2965.57|2972.52|It hadn't run for five minutes, and all of a sudden, bang-a-dee-bang, the pieces started flying around, and
2973.52|2974.96|And here a cog came.
2974.98|2980.83|That's the thing with the teeth on that really does the trashing.
2980.85|2984.99|And dropped out of place, had gone through the machine, and got into the blower.
2985.07|2986.58|And the blower is a great big thing.
2986.6|2988.58|It takes about 20 horsepower to turn it.
2989.98|2994.39|And it really just hammered things to pieces.
2994.41|2998.55|So he said right away, he said, "You fix up the front end, I'll fix up the back."
2998.57|3000.84|Well, it took us about two hours, and we had the machine.
3003.25|3005.39|When they got going, he came back to me.
3005.41|3007.25|He said, "I think we get along all right."
3008.67|3022.55|And I was hired right then and there.
3022.57|3025.89|Well, that was an experience, anyway, for a young fellow.
3026.37|3028.62|This is what the fellow in the service station said,
3028.64|3031.96|"A kid like you run Martin Twight's outfit - separator?"
3031.96|3033.0|I said, "Yes."
3033.56|3038.34|"Oh," he said, "You're too young for a job like that."
3038.48|3043.85|Well, Martin Twight's ... ran the ..., I ran the separator.
3043.87|3046.53|We ran for 30 days straight.
3046.99|3049.68|Went - ran right through, Sundays and all.
3049.7|3052.72|We averaged 12 hours a day belt time.
3052.74|3057.93|That meant that that machine had to be, the belts had to be turning 12 hours a day.
3059.41|3065.47|And I want to tell you that every night I worked until midnight, lacing belts and getting everything ready.
3065.59|3070.34|You just didn't stop during the day when that machine started
3070.36|3073.38|you said, "I don't want that machine to stop."
3073.44|3080.13|But in the 30 days, I had a 30-minute tie-up.
3080.17|3080.57|Just once.
3081.57|3084.43|And the engineer, he had an hour and a quarter.
3085.19|3087.15|Something went wrong with his governor on his engine. He was ...
3090.81|3097.94|But sleeping in a haymow with a horse blanket was the only covers that you got.
3097.96|3114.62|So I used to take my clothes off at night, shake the dust out of it, put everything back on but my high top boots, take the little straw under my head for a pillow, and lay down on the hard floor and cover myself up with a blanket.
3114.64|3119.3|Well, after about three, four hours, the boss would come,
3119.6|3124.65|and his way of calling was, "Daylight in the swamp, boys; daylight in the swamp."
3125.71|3130.3|Well, after laying on that hard floor for three, four hours, you were ready to get up and go.
3131.28|3138.09|This would be about maybe 4:40 or quarter to five in the morning when you'd be awakened.
3138.13|3141.21|The machine had to be running at 6 o'clock in the morning.
3141.23|3147.33|Oftentimes, you'd be out there - when it got a little later in the season, and it would hardly be light when we started throwing.
3148.30|3152.44|So that was it as far as thashing was concerned there.
3152.44|3155.43|I finished with them, then I went over to my uncle's place.
3155.45|3159.4|They had a machine, the same kind of machine.
3159.41|3162.32|And it was sort of a combine ...
3162.34|3164.5|It was in one heck of a shape.
3164.52|3167.31|And they asked me to run the separator.
3167.47|3169.57|So it happened to be a rainy spell.
3169.59|3176.7|I worked everything over, cleaned it all up, relaced all the belts and everything.
3176.72|3178.06|And then we started thrashing with it.
3178.45|3179.83|The machine never stopped.
3179.85|3181.15|It just kept going all day long.
3181.45|3183.37|And these fellows, they couldn't figure it out.
3183.39|3190.56|They said, "That machine never ran an hour at one time without something going wrong with it.
3190.58|3195.11|It would have a breakdown or something, a belt would break or something like that."
3195.12|3201.05|But that's how I thrashed 30 days for Brighton, and I thrashed 12 days for them.
3201.07|3205.34|And previously, I'd thrashed in Nebraska for about 20 days.
3205.36|3208.3|So I really had a long harvest.
3208.36|3211.85|I had a little money in my pocket.
3211.87|3217.01|When we were finished, I packed up and came back up to Canada.
3217.03|3223.98|So, I'll just take a little rest now.
3224.0|3227.11|Well, I headed for Canada.
3227.25|3237.48|When we were finished, I packed up and came back up to Canada.
3239.85|3244.06|I'll just take a little rest now.
3244.08|3247.21|Well, I headed for Canada.
3252.27|3253.98|I'll have to get myself straightened out.
3255.32|3259.19|Oh yes, I just came back up to the farm for about a week.
3259.21|3261.27|Then I went back down to South Dakota.
3262.72|3266.88|And on the way down, I was driving right through the night.
3267.21|3270.85|About daylight in the morning, I fell asleep at the wheel and I rolled my car.
3271.99|3275.16|Well, I was just about the luckiest guy that ever lived.
3275.18|3278.8|I came out of that thing - it broke all the glass in it.
3278.82|3285.07|I mean, it was a Model T, Coupe. You wouldn't realize what it was like.
3285.09|3288.78|Broke all the glass in it and I came out of it without a cut or a scratch.
3288.8|3291.24|Made a complete rollover and landed up on the wheels.
3292.15|3298.2|But I was able to drive it into Valley City, North Dakota, and there I tied it together.
3298.28|3301.92|I was only about 80 miles from my uncle's place, and I drove on down there.
3303.14|3315.48|And when I got down there, well, I found out there's a power outfit working about 30 miles from there, and they were building a line into Frederick, South Dakota, what was where my uncle lived.
3315.5|3316.3|So I
3317.38|3325.93|got my car patched up enough that I was able to drive down to - to this town, Lola was the name of the town, see if I can get a job on this power line.
3325.93|3331.80|And the boss hired me right away, second class line 45 cents an hour and room and board.
3331.80|3343.64|So, I worked all winter on that job, right through the winter and ... The foreman on that crew was a,
3344.7|3348.86|a Finlander. A little guy about the size of Uncle Wally.
3350.15|3354.77|He was drunk when he hired me, and I think he stayed drunk every day.
3354.79|3357.18|He worked through the winter.
3357.32|3359.04|That was one of the jobs I had to do.
3359.06|3362.06|He'd keep me in to go and rustle a bottle of whiskey for him.
3362.08|3364.27|The country was dry, and he had to rustle his own booze.
3364.83|3369.15|He knew a guy that was a local there, and that I knew where to find things.
3370.31|3378.22|They went out from there, we went to Frederick, and then we moved up at - to Dawson, North Dakota, towards Spring.
3378.3|3384.07|We worked on the main Northern Pacific line there.
3384.13|3388.32|Not on the railroad, on the power line, putting in power along those small towns.
3390.06|3393.01|However, he took sick.
3393.03|3397.13|It used to be three packs of cigarettes a day, that was the rate he smoked.
3398.68|3407.43|And he took sick, and they shoved him into the hospital in Bismarck, and he died there.
3407.45|3413.13|So then we got another foreman on the job, and this fellow's name was Bill Oberts.
3414.32|3420.58|Mild-mannered individual, quietly spoken, but knew his business.
3420.94|3426.05|Frank Reynolds, the fellow that I just told about, he paid no attention.
3426.07|3427.93|He had his foreman run the outfit.
3428.43|3430.51|It was a pretty slipshod in many ways.
3431.59|3436.38|But Bill Oberts, he ran the outfit.
3436.62|3441.08|Then they brought another foreman in by the name of Marion, or "Matt", we called him,
3441.1|3441.95|Matt Huesby.
3443.03|3447.85|And he was a go-getter, a real professional lineman.
3447.87|3452.94|And then we built a big power line across country from
3454.4|3458.75|Thunderhawk, South Dakota, up to Algin North, right through No Man's Land.
3458.81|3463.41|There was a har... thing in that country, which is hills up and down ...
3463.43|3469.76|And we had our own camping house, but we slept in tents and had cook cars.
3469.86|3477.89|At that stage of the game when they brought a boring machine onto the job, that was something new at that time.
3478.01|3480.83|1928 this was.
3481.32|3487.03|So they went to operate 24 hours a day, and my buddy Elmer Jones was the operator on it.
3490.39|3494.68|He asked the timekeeper one day, "Who came to get to run that machine?"
3494.74|3497.48|I'll put Jones on a night game, get somebody to run it during the day.
3498.14|3501.01|A fellow by the name of Fitz Fisher was a very good friend of mine.
3501.03|3503.89|He was a lineman and timekeeper.
3503.91|3506.98|And he said, "Put Achen on that machine, he'll run it."
3507.06|3507.7|hH said, "I know he can."
3508.62|3513.27|So I was the daytime operator on it.
3513.29|3523.9|We had the job just about finished when harvest time came, and I had a telegraph from Twight, the thrasher up in Frederick, to come back and run the separator,
3523.92|3525.86|and that the wages would be $15 a day.
3526.1|3528.42|The previous year I had got $10 a day.
3530.27|3531.79|So I couldn't turn that down.
3532.01|3536.55|I was only making about $5 a day on the power line.
3537.31|3543.76|So I told the boss I was leaving, and I packed her up.
3543.78|3546.68|You didn't have much to pack in those days.
3546.7|3547.86|You didn't have many clothes.
3547.96|3553.95|One suitcase and probably a cardboard box was about all you carried with you.
3554.05|3559.58|And a Model T Coupe, you know, you couldn't carry much in it.
3559.6|3560.8|I headed back up to Frederick.
3561.46|3563.95|Well, we didn't have very good run thrashing that fall.
3563.97|3564.67|It was wet.
3565.69|3567.23|It rained a lot.
3568.02|3576.33|I don't remember what we got in, something about 25 days of thrashing, but I think it took us about two months to get it in. <break>
3591.68|3595.98|- stuck here, but I think I'm on the right track now.
3596.0|3603.37|I'll go back when I finish thrashing in Frederick and then headed north.
3603.37|3614.59|- about 25 days of thrashing, but I think it took us about two months to get it in.
3614.59|3619.53|And I started - didn't know what I was going to do, so I started north.
3619.53|3622.17|I got up as far as Minot.
3623.55|3627.36|When I got to Minot, I thought I'd look for a job - and I meant to check in here.
3627.36|3635.43|- you might get a job around here, and ... power company. "Yeah, sure you can get a job here,
3635.43|3639.58|right in the city you know."
3639.6|3640.84|Well, that was on a Friday, I think.
3640.86|3642.3|He said, "Come to work Monday morning."
3642.54|3644.58|Well, hung around there on Saturday and Sunday,
3644.73|3650.74|and I got looking around there and I thought, "Boy, you can really ... yourself quite a bit here."
3650.74|3654.37|You walk right up into a group of really well high-voltage in here.
3654.37|3660.41|And I knew something about working high-voltage, but not too much experience on it.
3660.41|3665.82|And, I got cold feet. |I never showed up for work.
3665.84|3670.11|Well, I'll head up towards Halbrite.
3670.96|3678.55|I get in the car, and I went up a line about 50 miles, and here's a small crew, power crew, working along the road.
3678.55|3692.49|So I stopped - ..., talked with the foreman, got on the line ..., now he's got a job.
3692.51|3695.59|"My God," he said, "You know, how much experience ..."
3695.62|3701.47|Well, he said, "You know, my head guy ... here, quitting and going some place else."
3701.96|3705.89|And, he said, "I could use another man. Do you want to come back until - 
3705.89|3710.39|Do you want ... the head office in Kenmare and see if they'll hire you?
3710.39|3713.74|I'll phone them and tell them you're coming in." So, I head up.
3713.74|3716.39|"Oh, yeah," They said, "sure we'll give you a job.
3716.39|3718.11|You'll go to work tomorrow morning.
3718.11|3719.71|79 cents an hour."
3719.71|3722.65|That was pretty good pay for that time.
3723.44|3726.86|Well, immediately I got to be the head lineman on that job.
3726.86|3729.82|They didn't have anybody there that had the experience that I had,
3729.82|3733.71|as they used to say, "cut the mustard".
3733.71|3744.74|And I got along very good. <break>
3744.86|3746.54|I've gone over this thing before.
3746.56|3751.72|I think that somewhere around I've got a tape that already has this information on it.
3752.28|3764.57|I'm going to stop now, because this is a continuous tape, where I think I had some on another tape, and I got mixed up on it.
3764.57|3767.91|But I'm taking the years as they come along now.
3769.31|3777.0|And I worked with that outfit all winter, working up along the - from Kenmare, North Dakota, up to -
3777.79|3787.87|to Portal, and then the east and west of that, we had about 150 miles of line, and we were called The Flying Squad. If there was trouble, when we were there.
3787.87|3790.56|Night or day, it didn't make any difference.
3793.85|3800.22|And I worked until, well, I'd say about in April,
3804.0|3818.29|and then, a man from the - the immigration one day and said, "Here, you can't work in this country, you're a Canadian, and you - you can't work down here unless you get a work permit."
3818.29|3819.65|So I packed it up.
3819.65|3829.61|Well, I haven't told this part - when I was at the farm before, Mother wanted to get off of the farm, so Mac and I said we'd take the farm over in the spring.
3831.35|3838.64|We took an inventory of everything that was there, all the machinery, and put a price on it, and we would pay for it as we'd go along.
3838.64|3853.52|So, when I had to leave the ... and go back up to Canada, and then it didn't make any hardships ...
3855.29|3858.09|So right now, I'm going to stop for a while,
3858.93|3874.34|and I'll play it back and see if I can find that other part, but I think I got some of that tape from ... from Saskatoon.
3874.34|3882.51|But I will try and put it in the proper chronological order so that it takes year after year if you wander on. Okay -
3889.94|3892.61|Now I'm trying to tape, for some reason or other,
3892.63|3895.17|this thing is not picking up.
3895.19|3900.66|I don't know what it is, whether some of the plugs came out on the side of the machine here or whatever -
3900.68|3902.26|I'll just check back and see.
3907.07|3913.89|Yeah, it was taping all right when I said, "That last bit about I'll just check back now and see."
3913.91|3918.38|So I'll just run off a little bit now and then I'll come back again and see what's happening.
3918.97|3926.76|It's tiresome talking into this thing, you know, when you're just sitting here talking to yourself, so to speak.
3926.78|3935.43|And I'm going to have to go without the whole webinar all again about when I come back up to Canterbury and went out to the farm and started working and see what happens.
3937.55|3938.39|It's hard -
3941.46|3950.9|Well, here we are, January the 20... January the 30th, 1981.
3951.64|3959.83|I haven't talked into this thing for, I think it could be going on for two months now.
3959.85|3965.44|And to get back, we got through Christmas, all the family were home.
3965.92|3971.45|I may have said that at the start here, I don't remember.
3971.47|3976.08|But not to be repetitious, the family were all home and we had one
3976.38|3981.72|wonderful time over Christmas over the holiday.
3981.74|3994.28|By the 2nd of January, they'd all gone back to their respective homes, and I presume they're all back working again.
3994.3|4007.9|To run with the story, after my run-in with the immigration authorities, I came back to the farm, and Mac and I started farming.
4007.92|4012.83|That was the spring of '29.
4016.21|4031.09|And we got along, short of rain, short crop, harvest was early, and by
4031.37|4033.82|the middle of September, all the work was done.
4034.7|4040.89|A friend of mine and myself went on a little bit of a spree one Saturday afternoon and landed up in Estevan.
4043.39|4050.64|And there I run across a friend of mine who worked for the power company.
4050.66|4053.08|And he told me he was a lineman.
4054.06|4057.67|"Well," I said, "If you're a lineman, get me a job."
4057.69|4060.13|I said, "I've been in the States for two years.
4061.14|4062.64|I'm fully experienced."
4065.39|4066.87|"Well," he said, "I'll talk to the boss.
4067.75|4070.19|He's going away in about a week.
4070.21|4073.94|And I'll talk to the boss and see if he wants to hire any men."
4073.96|4079.69|On Monday, I got a phone call, Monday night. "Come to work immediately."
4079.71|4084.25|So I headed back to work -
4084.43|4085.52|or, not back to work.
4085.64|4088.5|I headed to work in Estevan.
4088.52|4089.66|I run into a
4090.13|4093.64|crew of men, now, that had little experience.
4093.66|4096.42|They didn't know what it was all about.
4096.44|4104.63|So immediately, I was put on as head lineman and worked through the fall.
4107.44|4117.17|And about the end of November, the superintendent come along and he said, "I want to put you on as a - as a"
4119.56|4122.16|District Operator.
4122.16|4132.30|You'll be responsible for serving the people, reading the meters, and keeping the power going, all in their homes and what have you.
4132.30|4138.03|"Well," I said, "I don't even know how to read a meter." "Well," he said, "We'll teach you. ..."
4138.03|4146.29|So, we went on and about a week later
4146.29|4151.01|- job lasted all winter.
4151.01|4159.62|I headed back to the farm in the spring.
4162.22|4177.34|And when I got back to the farm, went up to Weyburn to see Mother, and by this time she had her fill of living in the city, she and Bud wanted to come back on the farm.
4178.22|4188.93|So we just tore up the contract we had signed, and I went back to work in Estevan.
4188.95|4203.85|Well, in the meantime, while I was off work, another foreman came in and took over, and they were crossing the river right at flood stage.
4205.18|4212.27|And my best friend, the fellow that had got me the job there the fall before, was in a boat that upset.
4213.41|4215.28|And as a result, he was drowned.
4216.42|4221.24|So they immediately called me and told me to advise his people.
4221.36|4222.54|He'd come from my hometown.
4223.79|4235.16|And then, when I went back down while they were searching for his body, it took them three days of combing the river before they found his body.
4235.44|4245.21|And in the meantime, I told them that my farm deal was off, so they said, "Well, come on back to work."
4245.23|4258.33|So I went right back to work, and when I get back there, this is one of the funny incidents where I put on a one-man strike.
4258.35|4263.66|I went back to work, and this foreman told me my wages were going to be something like 20 cents an hour less than I had been
4266.17|4269.03|receiving the fall before.
4269.05|4272.82|And I said, "Nothing doing."
4272.84|4276.44|I said, "I'm not going to accept that."
4276.46|4279.08|So I packed it up and I went home.
4280.65|4285.29|Went home to the farm and I bought a rifle, which I still have today,
4285.95|4288.49|I bought a rifle for $15 and a lot of shells.
4288.51|4290.3|I went out to the farm and I shot gophers.
4292.56|4295.08|And I've got to test this out now.
4295.84|4298.92|Yeah, well, the taping is going on all right.
4300.69|4313.51|To relate back to buying the rifle, and I bought 22 shots, long rifle, not long rifle, just long, for 15 cents a box.
4313.69|4315.21|That's the price of things.
4316.55|4321.1|And I went back to the farm, and I helped around the farm, and not doing much of anything.
4321.12|4321.98|In the meantime,
4323.75|4325.71|This all happened in a couple of days.
4327.65|4336.08|This funeral took place in Halbrite, and some of the big shots come up to the funeral.
4336.75|4341.63|And when they got to Halbrite, there was no place to eat, so they phoned out to the farm.
4341.65|4344.36|I'm out on strike now, don't forget.
4344.68|4349.08|But they phoned out to the farm and asked if they could come out and get a lunch.
4349.74|4351.34|Well, I said, "Most certainly."
4351.77|4352.73|There were four of them.
4354.02|4369.03|so they come out, and mother of course is always able to whip something up in a hurry, she got some home cured ham and some whole wheat bread that she had made and some pickles and she had a lunch out there for them in no time.
4369.69|4383.56|After they had this lunch, the two big shots walked out. And they went around the barn and we had - really had a good setup, everything looked nice. The barn was full of little pigs, and they were taken up with this.
4385.31|4390.34|They were out there before lunch, and when they come back in the house, had their lunch.
4390.36|4395.28|When they come out, my brother Mac was working on his car.
4396.37|4403.44|He was in working on the floorboards, and the car windows were open, and he had one door open.
4404.02|4407.58|And these fellows didn't know he was there, evidently.
4407.6|4410.81|And they were standing right beside the car talking, and they said -
4411.33|4414.53|One fellow said to the other, "Oh God, we've got to get Lind back to work.
4414.65|4419.32|A guy that can run a show like this is going to be a good man."
4419.34|4423.45|So - I didn't know anything about this.
4425.19|4427.89|I was preparing to go to the funeral.
4430.68|4438.13|When I come back from the funeral, my brother Mac said to me, he said, "Boy, you've got those guys right where the hair is short," he said.
4438.36|4443.41|"I overheard them saying that they've got to ask you to come back to work.
4443.43|4449.36|The guy that could operate a show like this had to be a good man."
4450.74|4454.88|So it was - no more said about it.
4455.7|4462.47|And I was on the train on the way up to Weyburn when the general manager of the company was on the train.
4465.68|4467.14|He had come up from Estevan.
4467.86|4470.3|He said, "I thought you were back in Estevan working."
4470.32|4474.85|I said, "No, I said, I'm still at the farm doing nothing."
4474.87|4478.21|"Well, hell," he said, "They were supposed to call you back to work."
4481.11|4485.66|So that next morning, I get a phone call, "Come on back to work immediately."
4485.92|4488.18|Well, I went back to Estevan.
4489.0|4490.96|I started working for this same foreman.
4490.98|4495.27|He was a German fellow and a kind of a bully type with his crew.
4495.43|4496.79|He didn't have a good crew.
4497.78|4504.13|And he - he just had them running every time he hollered, they would run.
4504.13|4507.94|Well, I had never done that for any foreman and I wasn't running for him.
4507.94|4521.29|I go back to work my first paycheck comes, It's not the wages I got before it was eight cents an hour less.
4522.16|4529.03|So I went to him I said, "Look, who put in these wages for me?"
4529.03|4536.67|He says - "Lindy," he says, "When I saw you work he says I put in the full wages for you but somebody in the office cut it back."
4536.67|4546.83|"Well," I said, "In the meantime I'm only going to do 70 cents worth of work an hour not 78, until I find out get to talk to the superintendent."
4546.83|4552.85|Well, time went on. And, one of the fellas -"
4553.62|4554.78|Well, this fellow left then.
4554.8|4565.12|He went with the coal company, he was their electrician, and another fellow took over the crew, a fellow by the name of Bill Wilson, whom I had known.
4566.08|4568.08|Bill had an accident.
4568.1|4570.45|A pole dropped on him, and he broke his leg.
4571.69|4577.58|Well, the superintendent comes down right away to straighten things out, and I hear he's in town. And boy, I -
4586.78|4591.77|I was just ready to blast him about the wages.
4591.79|4595.39|When he said, "You heard Bill Wilson was hurt?"
4595.41|4596.13|I said, "Yeah."
4597.47|4600.38|"Well," he said, "Lind, I wonder if you could run the crew."
4603.24|4606.64|- No, "Do you think you could run the crew?"
4606.66|4607.99|I said, "You think I could?"
4609.61|4611.19|He says, "Yes, I think you could."
4611.21|4615.87|"Well," I said, "If you think I could, well, I'm thinking the same thing."
4616.33|4618.13|So I was put in charge of the crew.
4618.45|4620.75|He said, "Your wage is $0.85 an hour."
4621.25|4622.95|So that part of it was settled.
4624.14|4639.53|And it, well, this would have been about the first part of May - but maybe the middle of May.
4639.55|4643.09|And I had a crew of about eight men.
4644.24|4646.7|And in those days you didn't have much in equipment.
4646.72|4655.11|We had a one and a half ton truck and everything was done the hard way in hand tools.
4655.13|4671.93|However, I had a pretty well organized crew and we spent that summer - we had gone out through Assiniboia, did a little work onto Kincaid, and from there north up to Davidson.
4671.95|4673.49|And at Davidson we
4673.52|4695.53|possibly spent a month in Davidson, and then on up to Biggar, east of Saskatoon, where we were doing a complete rebuild of the distribution system in a town of about 2,500 people, rebuilding the system right from stem to stern.
4695.55|4700.35|So, everything was going fine.
4702.68|4704.14|No problems up there.
4705.54|4723.02|And I might relate that on the 4th day of October, we had a snowstorm that was so severe, and Biggar is on the main line of the CNR, all the trains were tied up.
4723.04|4729.34|In the town of Biggar itself, the only thing that could move up and down the streets was a team of horses on a gray wagon.
4730.32|4734.34|That was the only thing that was moving, well, after two days of storm.
4735.35|4739.13|The crops were still out - very - well -
4739.45|4744.54|Some harvesting had been done, but farther to the north, most of the grain was still out in the fields.
4744.62|4748.42|It had been raining.
4748.44|4754.79|However, in about ten days, it warmed up and the snow all went away and it was just like summer.
4756.17|4758.1|I went - I worked there until about the
4759.58|4764.55|first of December when this fellow Bill Wilson was able to come back to work again.
4766.57|4773.8|So I got word from the superintendent that Bill was coming to take over the crew and I was to come back to Estevan.
4776.02|4782.13|I went back to Estevan and I was more or less a one-man crew there by myself.
4782.81|4787.7|It was decided to come to increase all the voltage in the city, which was done
4787.81|4791.13|through reconnecting the transformers.
4791.15|4804.25|And I had just a helper, and myself. We would take the town one section at a time, and it was a great experience for me to cut the town over.
4805.53|4808.55|And got it all completed without any problems.
4809.99|4817.18|I suppose it was into the middle of January when I finished that end of it, and we were working around on
4817.44|4818.72|different projects.
4819.41|4821.07|I picked up a couple of more men.
4822.05|4835.78|And then it was in the middle of January when I saw an ad in the paper that the Power Commission were hiring linemen to be district operators.
4835.88|4840.0|So I went to the superintendent and I said, "What about this?"
4840.02|4842.43|"Well," he said, "Things are kind of slow around here.
4842.45|4844.97|And," he said, "they will undoubtedly
4846.05|4848.81|be in business a long time after we're gone."
4850.31|4851.97|"So," he said, "If you want to put in an application,
4852.03|4853.61|I'll give you a good recommendation."
4853.63|4865.47|So I put in an application and it was just a matter of three or four days, I get a phone call to report for duty.
4865.65|4870.45|So I come up to Regina and
4872.17|4877.62|they put us through a briefing, a three-day briefing, to show us all the bookwork, etc.
4878.74|4888.27|And to relate a little bit on conditions, there was no snow in the country.
4888.29|4900.61|The roads were all bare from Estevan up here, and on the 21st day of January, if I recall correctly, I went to Saskatoon, and there was no snow on the highway on the way to Saskatoon.
4901.3|4902.8|The whole country was bare.
4903.46|4906.96|And when I hit Saskatoon, I was put in charge of this district there.
4908.37|4914.76|Eleven towns running out - lines running out three different directions from Saskatoon.
4914.78|4917.88|But I really had - well, the job was so soft, I got tired laying around.
4917.9|4920.06|I had orders not to travel.
4920.08|4922.13|I was being paid mileage for my car, and
4922.61|4925.87|I had orders not to be traveling unless it was necessary.
4926.37|4929.06|So about the only thing I would do is go out meter reading.
4930.17|4933.85|Well, there was the odd job to turn up here and there, which I'd take care of.
4934.89|4939.72|However, I got a truck after I was there, about two months, they got me a half-ton truck.
4939.74|4945.55|And then about in June of that year, the superintendent asked me if I would go to Rosetown.
4945.57|4954.24|A fellow down there had got into difficulties, a good lineman, but he couldn't keep his bookwork straight, so I was transferred to Rosetown,
4954.94|4965.31|an increase of $10 a month in my wages, which was from $145 a month to $155 a month, big wages at that time.
4965.77|4970.84|And by that time, the unemployment had hit the country.
4970.86|4979.51|Every train that come through would have 50 to 100 people riding on it, going I don't know where, but they were looking for work.
4979.53|4982.25|Nobody could get a job.
4982.27|4984.59|It was just that tough.
4986.83|4992.28|I was in Rosetown, and there I had eight towns to look after.
4992.3|4996.39|They went out in two different directions out of Rosetown.
4996.67|5002.84|I worked pretty hard there for two or three months straightening up all the distribution system, which had been built in the wintertime.
5002.86|5007.2|The poles were all leaning here and there, and the anchors were pulling.
5007.22|5016.54|I would hire a fellow to help me for 30 or 35 cents an hour, and I worked hard at that job and got these towns all straightened up.
5017.65|5023.55|And then I caught hell from the superintendent for hiring a man without authority.
5023.57|5034.31|And, another thing he raised hell with me about was building a toolbox for $18, paid a carpenter for $18 for a toolbox.
5034.33|5035.71|And I had no authority for that.
5036.59|5043.23|So I was - told the superintendent in Saskatoon,
5044.09|5054.26|headquarters in Regina were riding me about these tools and I said, "I'm going to tell him to stick the job up his rear end. I don't have to take that from anybody."
5055.18|5072.08|So, I was a bit dissatisfied the way things were going and I suppose independent as hell. I had money in the bank I'd bought a brand new car in Rosetown - a brand new Ford Coach for nine-hundred and -
5072.19|5080.76|no, $819 is what I paid for it, to give you an idea of car prices at that time.
5082.08|5086.09|Anyway, then I had taken a trip down home.
5086.11|5088.41|I got a few days off and went down home.
5088.43|5091.3|And mother was wanting to go to Iowa.
5091.56|5093.88|She said, "She wished she could take another trip to Iowa."
5094.62|5097.03|I had taken her down there.
5097.33|5099.05|No, I hadn't ever taken her down.
5099.07|5100.17|That was the first trip.
5101.04|5107.39|"So," I said, "Well, I'll sign off my job and take off time and
5107.47|5109.29|I'll take you down there."
5109.31|5114.32|So I told the superintendent, I said, "I'm going to book off for three, four months."
5115.6|5118.75|"Well," he said, "We can't guarantee your job when you come back."
5118.77|5122.27|"Well," I said, "I don't care if you guarantee my job or not.
5122.29|5123.61|I want to take the time off."
5123.63|5126.71|So I left and when I came through Regina
5127.86|5129.94|I went into the head office and this
5130.42|5136.38|head guy told me, "Boy you've sure done an ace-high job for us out there."
5136.38|5147.61|And that's all there was to it. I went down and mother and I took the trip to Iowa which was a wonderful time we're down there about six weeks.
5147.61|5153.55|I think I left about the end of September, and come back.
5153.55|5161.30|And when I got back to Halbrite - Midale, here Midale we're going to put in the power plant, and a power system.
5162.29|5168.88|So right away they heard I was back. "How about coming and building the lines for us?" I said, "Sure, I'll take on that job."
5168.88|5178.83|So I went down and supervised - laid out the lines for them and everything. Built - you could get help in those days. No trouble getting help.
5180.30|5191.07|And in the course of building the line the Power Corporation found out I was working, see?
5192.32|5196.45|So one of the guys, the superintendent, kind of took a dig at me.
5196.47|5205.18|After I had built the system, then my brother Mac and I started wiring houses, and we wired all the houses in Midale, which is a total winter job.
5206.12|5207.9|So that was all cleaned up in the spring.
5207.92|5210.39|I went back to the power to see if I could get a job.
5213.37|5218.7|And, oh, the superintendent, he - no, the general manager, oh, he got -
5219.66|5229.89|he got so nasty with me that I still don't know today how I didn't just climb over his desk and flatten his face in for him.
5229.97|5233.15|And anyway, I didn't have to work.
5233.27|5234.37|I had money in the bank
5234.59|5237.5|I went back home and stayed on the farm.
5237.52|5243.18|I worked around - messed around there for my keep, and I had one hell of a good time that whole summer.
5243.2|5248.25|And in the fall, I went down to Estevan, and I went in to see the superintendent there.
5249.04|5257.85|So I told him about this general manager giving me such a bad time.
5259.84|5261.62|He said, "Linden, they can't do that to you."
5261.64|5264.7|He said, "We've got some work coming up.
5264.72|5269.83|You go home and get your tools and come on down here and we'll get you to work."
5269.85|5275.62|That would have been about in October, I would say.
5275.64|5277.12|Maybe the first of October.
5277.98|5281.06|because there was snow on the ground shortly after I got there.
5281.5|5282.58|And I worked there about a month.
5283.79|5288.21|And then they were starting up a power plant out at Tompkins.
5288.23|5294.42|One of their men was a fellow that I worked under, while I was in Estevan,
5294.44|5297.12|he was superintendent of the steam plant.
5297.14|5301.89|And he was dissatisfied there, so he went out to start up this plant at Tompkins.
5301.91|5307.51|It was a little town of 350 people out west of Swift Current.
5309.64|5318.87|So I packed up and went out to Tompkins and built the distribution system out there, and then again went into wiring for the winter.
5319.57|5326.19|After the system was going, I started wiring houses, and I kept relatively busy all winter.
5326.32|5338.43|Now we're talking into the winter of 1932 was the year that I was at home on the farm.
5338.86|5349.91|And the fall of '32, I went to Tompkins.
5349.93|5351.88|Yes.
5351.98|5358.58|And then in, no, that's, I mixed up there someplace.
5358.62|5360.74|'32, I didn't work.
5360.76|5364.59|And it must have been most of '33 I didn't work.
5364.61|5366.17|Fall of '33, I landed out at Tompkins
5367.75|5368.65|put in that system,
5369.49|5372.15|and wired houses all winter.
5372.17|5386.11|And then the spring of '34, Dubois, the superintendent, this was still the same company that was in Estevan, he said, "I'm putting you down in Gull Lake to do some wiring there.
5386.13|5390.55|There's a bunch of the business places, the wiring is such a hell of a mess."
5390.57|5394.6|"And," he said, "we want to spend some money and straighten it out on account of it."
5394.62|5395.62|...
5396.92|5399.28|So I went into Gull Lake, and I -
5400.71|5401.85|I did these jobs.
5401.97|5404.42|I probably worked there a month.
5404.9|5418.72|As I remember, three of the bigger businesses there that I worked in put in the metering setup and the whole panel and everything for their electric system had to be changed around.
5418.74|5423.19|And then when that was finished, he said, "Now, I'm going to put you out to overhaul in the distri -"
5424.84|5430.79|down there, I lined up there - there's a bunch of wiring to be done in that town, so I spent a month in there wiring.
5432.71|5441.95|And, uh, as I remember it, I finished and went back up to Gull Lake on Armistice Day.
5441.97|5449.66|Well, there wasn't much to do around Gull Lake, so there was some wiring to be done in Tompkins, and I moved back to Tompkins.
5449.68|5453.14|There you could get room and board for a dollar a day.
5455.08|5457.08|So I went back up.
5457.2|5464.93|By this time, Jack Dyer was getting kind of tired of running the power plant.
5464.95|5466.37|He - It was too small for him,
5467.09|5470.0|and he was in financial problem - difficulties.
5470.02|5472.5|He was in the hole all over the place.
5472.52|5474.24|I saw this.
5474.26|5477.45|He wasn't doing a very big job running the plant.
5477.47|5478.85|It was a diesel plant.
5479.87|5483.55|He was having a lot of power outages and what have you, So
5484.22|5486.43|one day I said to him, "You're dissatisfied here."
5486.45|5489.25|I said, "If you'd like to get out of here,"
5489.27|5491.31|I said, "I'll take over.
5491.33|5492.35|I'll buy you out."
5495.56|5497.28|"Well, what kind of a deal were you on for?"
5497.34|5499.27|So we sat down at we talked.
5499.29|5500.83|- what kind of deal that I would give him.
5501.59|5505.96|I would pay all the debts that he owed, and get him cleaned out of that one -
5505.98|5508.64|I'd give him my car, and I'd give him some cash.
5510.6|5512.0|"By God," he said, "I'll go for that."
5513.74|5519.67|So I phoned up Walter Stasher, the general manager in Estevan, and told him about this deal.
5519.69|5521.47|"Well, hell," he said, "We'll give you money.
5521.79|5525.17|If you want to buy him out, we're not happy with the way he's running the thing anyway."
5526.96|5532.95|So they staked me - It wasn't a matter of any amount of money.
5532.97|5539.29|I remember I borrowed $600 off of Mother, and they staked me for the rest of it.
5539.31|5541.84|There, I had a job running a power plant.
5543.32|5546.65|My wages were $120 a month.
5547.07|5551.17|Well, that gave me plenty to live on.
5551.91|5559.35|I traded in my car, so I didn't have a car, so they wrestled me up an old truck they had sitting down in Estevan.
5559.37|5561.73|They put new tires on it.
5561.75|5567.52|Drove in to Regina, and I came in here and picked it up, and I had a truck to work with.
5567.54|5569.7|Well, my brother Mac was out of work, so he came out.
5570.08|5571.5|He and Ellen moved out there.
5573.29|5580.04|And he was mechanically inclined, so it took him no time at all to learn how to run the power plant.
5580.06|5585.04|So then I went out working for the Dominion Electrics.
5585.06|5587.51|I was still managing the power plant.
5587.53|5589.07|Paid Mac and Ellen a wage.
5589.09|5593.63|They had a house, rented a house, and they had a place to live.
5593.65|5600.34|And I went out and worked for them on the - overhauled the power line between Shaunavon and Assiniboia.
5600.36|5601.56|Had a four-man crew.
5602.7|5613.53|And we worked there all summer, right up until, I would say, about the 1st of October, when again they'd run out of money.
5613.55|5616.72|We hadn't finished the job, and they said, "Well, that's it."
5616.74|5625.89|So then I went back to Tompkins, and between Mac and I, we had nothing much to do but run the power plant and a little wiring.
5625.91|5629.37|I used to go around doing wiring any place in the country.
5632.93|5638.15|There were no electricians out in there. And that - now we're into 1934.
5638.15|5648.68|It was in 1934 that the electrician - the inspector who used to come through there said to me one day, "Why don't you write your journeyman's paper?" he said, "You're a good electrician."
5648.68|5659.37|So, I went up to Moose Jaw and they held a writing in there, and it was the worst headache I ever had in my life. I went in there, they give you a -
5661.07|5662.94|oh, what the hell did they call it a -
5663.74|5666.72|(code book) - a book of rules and regulations.
5666.74|5669.63|The "code book", yeah.
5669.65|5674.09|And there they give you a bunch of questions, and you dig the answers out of the code book and put down on paper.
5674.17|5685.77|Well, this I found very, very difficult, not having ever had to use a code book and figure out jobs according to the code.
5688.36|5694.15|And I, when I went out of that place that night, I had the God-darnest headache that a man ever had in his life.
5694.17|5696.45|I didn't figure I made it.
5696.47|5703.48|Well, about ten days later, I get word that I had passed my examination.
5703.5|5710.43|Well, I was never so happy in my life as when I got that journeyman's paper.
5710.45|5713.14|That was in the fall of 1934.
5715.02|5717.42|So that - I spent thirty -
5719.17|5725.56|nineteen thirty - yeah, '35, running a power plant and wiring.
5725.58|5733.95|And then in '36, they decided they were going to run a power line from Gull Lake to Tompkins, and abandoned this little power plant.
5734.95|5739.1|Found out they could serve it cheaper in Gull Lake, and they had plenty of capacity there.
5739.92|5745.45|And they were going to put the power plant up to Winnipegosis, Manitoba.
5746.35|5749.03|So I was going to be out of a job just that fast.
5749.28|5757.4|Well, when the dust was settled, I came out of there with $2,000 for my equity in the power plant.
5761.3|5763.57|And they said, "You'll go up." -
5763.59|5767.24|Oh yeah, I was made a foreman on the line while the line was being built.
5767.26|5769.8|Well, that job only lasted about six weeks.
5770.93|5777.66|And then I went up, they said, "We're putting the plant up to Winnipegosis, Manitoba, and we want you to go up there and wire up the town.
5778.1|5781.22|Not the line, but the inside wiring of the town.
5781.24|5786.73|We've got to have somebody up there that will do it at a reasonable price that we get customers."
5786.75|5794.36|So when I went up, and Ellen - my brother Mac, and Ellen, they broke up housekeeping there, and she went back to her parents in Estevan.
5795.08|5798.96|I don't mean that they parted, they - The work run out, so to speak.
5799.97|5809.53|They shipped their stuff back to Estevan, and Mac came up to Winnipegosis, Manitoba with me where we wired houses there.
5808.00|5809.59|I want to interject now.
5810.03|5824.49|This same man Dyer, when he left Tompkins, he went up to Winnipegosis and organized the starting of a power plant in Winnipegosis.
5824.55|5826.0|Well, he got himself into -
5826.21|5830.38|He got the franchise but then he bogged down right then and there, and -
5830.38|5844.12|He hollered to me for help so - I couldn't see where I could help him any, so I turned the whole issue over to the Dominion Electric, the old power company in Estevan.
5844.12|5853.14|And they took over and he headed for British Columbia where he spent the rest of his days.
5853.14|5857.43|So we'll go on taping again about Winnipegosis.
5860.78|5869.11|- June, July, August, September, October, and by the middle of November we were finished.
5869.13|5883.42|We had everything wired up, so we packed up and went back to- oh yes, I was promised a job when they closed the plant down in Tompkins, that I would have a job at Estevan;
5885.22|5886.77|back at Estevan again.
5886.79|5891.83|They were transferring the guy out of there to some other place.
5891.85|5903.6|So while I was wiring up at Winnipegosis, this fella took holidays, and they sent me down to Estevan for one month to take charge of the district there.
5903.62|5911.59|And then Mac and I, we "checked out", as I said, about the middle of November, and he went back to Midale.
5912.37|5914.24|And I went back to Estevan and went to work.
5915.87|5917.15|And I worked in Estevan.
5917.17|5919.03|That was the fall of '37.
5920.8|5930.63|Then I was in charge of the lines there for the rest of '37, '38, '39, '40.
5931.83|5935.34|The war was full swing.
5935.36|5936.94|And, on, I was married that fall.
5937.4|5941.59|Married on the end of November in '40.
5945.27|5952.66|Then the airport came in in 1941, so it was really a busy time around there.
5952.82|5962.07|God, I went - there were times there during the war that I worked 10 hours a day, 7 days a week. ...
5962.07|5973.05|And be out a night doing refrigeration work. There was nobody to repair refrigerators, so I got a repair manual, and I took that up as a sideline.
5974.05|5977.76|And I just worked like a slave all during the war.
5978.58|5980.04|I could have gone into the Navy.
5980.3|5981.7|I put my application in.
5982.64|5990.97|I could have gone into the commission as a first-class warrant officer, which is equivalent to a sergeant.
5991.58|5997.82|And Phyllis and I talked it over, and
5997.84|6001.87|well, I had seen the guys that were in the Army and talked to them.
6002.4|6008.59|And everybody was having one hell of a time and 4,000 miles away from their families.
6009.75|6013.9|And we talked it over and said, "Well -" I was "frozen",
6013.92|6014.42|my job as DES.
6014.94|6020.22|The company had got an order that I didn't - couldn't be drafted.
6022.01|6026.57|So I said, "OK, I'll stay here and slug it out.
6027.33|6030.99|Let somebody else fight the war while I work harder than anybody
6031.35|6035.89|in the Army ever thought of working."
6036.03|6039.21|And everything was going well, fine.
6039.23|6043.76|Here, every six months they had to apply for a deferment for me.
6043.78|6045.8|They forgot to apply for the deferment here.
6045.84|6051.16|One morning I get a telegram, "Report for duty in the King's Army."
6054.07|6055.89|Well, my God.
6055.91|6060.59|Now here, here I turned down an officer's job
6061.01|6090.63|in the navy, and now here I'm going to be just a foot soldier in the Army.
6068.03|6072.80|So I went in and I said to the general manager, Stasher was still there.
6072.80|6084.93|"Well," I said, "What the hell have you guys run me into now?" "Oh God," he said, "We forgot to get your deferment," so he said, "I'll take care of that."
6084.93|6090.99|Well, the next day I got a telegram not - He knew some of the big shots up
6090.73|6094.55|in Regina here, and they they called it off.
6095.17|6100.77|So I spent the war years in Estevan.
6102.83|6105.72|And it was after the war that - 
6110.48|6120.60|Oh yeah, the company had moved up into the Peace River country pretty strong by that time, and the superintendent spending a lot of time up there.
6120.60|6123.37|So I was pretty well in charge of everything at Estevan.
6123.61|6128.26|And here, one day, they had a big generator blow up.
6128.28|6134.18|And the general manager asked me to go down and look at it, give a report to New York of what had to be done.
6134.2|6137.21|He didn't know anything about the wiring in the generator.
6138.51|6141.81|So I went down, looked it over.
6141.83|6144.38|They had the machine all opened up.
6144.4|6147.06|I took a note of what was, and we went up into the office
6148.09|6153.41|and drafted a telegram to send to New York to tell them what damage had happened.
6153.43|6163.24|Well, when this was over, while we were sitting there talking, and I said, "I see by the Leader Post that they're advertising for line construction for the Power Commission."
6164.8|6174.09|I said, "I got a damn good notion to take a swing at it."
6174.11|6176.68|I said, "I know how to build power lines."
6177.65|6178.81|He said, "Why don't you?"
6179.21|6181.36|He said, "You're young."
6181.38|6188.35|He said, "I'll give you a leave of absence, and if you don't, if you don't get any contracts, well, you can come back to work."
6188.41|6194.22|I won't promise you that you'll be back here in Estevan, but there'll be a job for you.
6194.24|6195.72|"Well," I said, "Sure."
6195.76|6203.61|So I hopped on the bus the next day, or drove up, I forget.
6203.63|6206.71|Come up to Regina, got a set of tender forms, and I sat down in a room -
6207.44|6212.26|Oh, yeah, he said, "In the meantime, why don't you take Harry Monaghan on for a partner?"
6212.28|6216.69|Harry was an old friend of his and had built lines way back in the 20s.
6217.93|6219.59|He said, "He's an experienced man.
6219.61|6223.35|He'll be a great partner for you."
6223.37|6224.46|So we come up here.
6224.48|6228.46|Well, Harry was out of touch with things.
6228.48|6229.84|I sat down and
6229.9|6233.49|I filled out the tenders.
6233.75|6236.11|They were to be opened one up there.
6236.83|6251.55|And by God, I get - the first job I get is building a line from Halbrite to Midale and the distribution system in - yeah, and Macoun - and the distribution system in Macoun and Halbrite.
6251.57|6260.9|And at the same time bid on a big heavy, high voltage line from Estevan to Stoughton, and I get that too.
6260.92|6263.28|Well, here I am, I got two contracts.
6264.07|6272.8|I've got $2,000, maybe $3,000 in the bank, and I'm a contractor, just like that.
6272.82|6277.18|Well, that was an experience that I'm going to take off time,
6278.17|6281.35|now, I've been talking here for the best part of an hour.
6282.07|6286.9|I'm going to take off time and come back.
6286.94|6293.7|Then we'll be out of my years working for a company,
6293.95|6301.62|Now I'm a contractor on my own, and the time is the end of September 1945.
6302.74|6307.83|So I'll click this off right now, and I don't know when I'll get back at it again.
6308.21|6314.86|I'll give you a history of my years of contracting, which was from 1945 to 1965.
6315.46|6316.32|Bye right now.
6317.88|6319.0|So I don't know
6319.82|6321.91|whether I continued on or not -
6321.93|6323.31|well, there it is -
6323.33|6325.59|September the 14th, 1981.
6327.86|6345.8|I can't remember when I run off the last of that tape when I said - I started to talk, "I'm a contractor now, and I don't know when I'll talk into this thing again."
6345.82|6348.91|I think it was possibly back in September.
6349.25|6349.63|However,
6352.58|6372.35|to get into my years of contracting, I would have to get wound up just right - in the right mood to sort of give you an idea of what it was like to start out from scratch as a contractor.
6372.35|6378.39|I had, I would say, $3,000 in the bank.
6378.39|6381.28|I didn't own a car. I sold my car.
6383.24|6386.72|But I had a wealth of knowledge in the construction business.
6388.95|6398.45|So the first thing to do was to come to Regina and tender on work here.
6399.30|6400.71|Two projects coming up.
6400.71|6406.10|One was a power line from Midale to Halbrite and Macoun,
6407.73|6422.48|and the other was a high-voltage suspension-type line, 72,000 volts, which was something new in Saskatchewan at that time, from Estevan to Stoughton, which was a distance of 40 miles.
6423.73|6440.43|Well, I then set down and figure out how much is that going to cost you to do a job, you could only dig out of the back of your head and say, so many men do so much work, and then bring that out to hours,
6440.83|6447.71|and choose the number of cents per hour, or dollars, whatever it was -
6448.44|6449.74|cents in those days.
6449.74|6452.73|You didn't pay anybody a dollar an hour.
6452.73|6464.03|And what your equipment would cost you, and then say, "Well, it's going to cost me so many thousand dollars to do that job and I've got to add on profit,
6464.03|6466.88|and this is what my tender price would be."
6467.65|6470.67|The first job was really a difficult one. It was dismantling two airports. One at -
6483.43|6476.43|That seems to be where everything stops. I can't find any tape beyond what you just heard there. So, I'm going to
6499.17|6517.55|call this to a halt for the time being, and as I said there earlier on the tape, in order to give an outline of what contracting was like for the next 18 years.
6518.97|6521.41|I'll need to be in the right frame of mind.
6521.85|6531.59|So with that I'm going to say "Good night" and the date right now is May the 5th, 1986.
6531.59|6542.05|so I've been monkeying around for five years on this thing and I haven't come up with anything very interesting, as I see it in going over it.
6542.75|6548.80|However, we'll finish it out and give you a rundown on what it was like to be contracting.
6551.07|6555.57|This is May the 8th.
6557.88|6566.59|And, I don't know if I feel like talking this morning or not, but I'll make an attempt at it.
6566.59|6577.47|First off, I want to say things were pretty well modeled up on my tapes, having spoken into them over a period of five years.
6578.79|6584.24|And then the kids would get into them, and some of it would get erased.
6585.67|6594.88|All the way along, it may be hard for you to follow this story as it was unfolding.
6597.83|6614.36|But I just want to say that it would be awfully hard to sit down and just give the history over 18 years, 20 years virtually.
6614.9|6629.6|I started working on power in 1927, and then I worked until just about the end of '45 for various companies.
6629.62|6632.22|And through all that I was gaining experience.
6632.28|6635.3|The biggest thing was handling men.
6636.53|6642.71|After the first two years that I was in the electrical
6644.72|6649.4|business, I was always in charge of men.
6651.18|6657.39|And that's the big thing when you're contracting, is you depend on your men doing the work.
6657.43|6659.31|You don't do it yourself.
6659.33|6665.64|And you have to organize your men and have them working for you and not against you.
6665.66|6672.34|And during the years that I worked for the power company, you always - oh - you had difficulties.
6672.36|6674.61|Guys would get hard to handle, and
6675.53|6685.1|they'd buck you a little bit, and you always - just one thing you had to do, and that's plow them under and keep on moving ahead.
6685.16|6686.22|You never look back.
6686.24|6693.73|If you had any labor problems, you waded through them and kept on going.
6697.15|6704.88|So to get back to when I started out from Midale,
6705.62|6707.44|That's where I started building.
6708.36|6710.42|I didn't have any equipment.
6710.44|6717.01|First thing I did, I went to a dealer in Estevan, and he had a half-ton truck there.
6717.47|6719.51|And trucks were hard to come by at that time.
6719.57|6722.68|This truck had about 60,000 miles on it.
6723.12|6724.26|It was in pretty bad shape.
6725.86|6729.22|But I had to have a half-ton truck, and it was the only one available.
6729.24|6733.89|So I virtually took it from him.
6734.21|6738.29|I said, "I'm going to have that truck, and you can't sell it to anybody else."
6738.31|6742.25|I happened to know the dealer very well.
6742.27|6743.16|That was the start.
6743.2|6745.42|I had a half-ton truck.
6745.44|6750.74|Then I rented a man with a truck when I started dismantling airports.
6752.93|6760.11|And then I got word that there was some military trucks being sold in Regina.
6761.22|6764.21|In fact, the Power Corporation tipped us off to that.
6765.75|6775.3|So I come up and I bought an old gun carrier, a great big awkward thing that was built for pulling a gun around the country.
6776.48|6779.28|And, what they called, another was a "1500 weight".
6779.3|6786.23|It was about a two-ton truck, but equipped for battlefield work.
6786.25|6790.99|So I took those trucks and revamped them, took them down to Midale and,
6791.28|6793.28|my brother ran a little garage there,
6794.6|6796.0|he was able to do welding.
6796.08|6809.32|And between the two of us, we got the cutting torches going and got them, made something that would start to function.
6809.34|6810.8|There was no steel in the country.
6810.84|6811.24|There wasn't -
6811.26|6814.52|You couldn't buy anything after the war.
6814.54|6818.57|And so I made a wooden derrick -
6818.85|6823.6|tripod on the back of this Army truck for setting poles.
6826.04|6829.85|We had no digging equipment, just dug the holes by hand.
6832.03|6838.92|And I was fortunate enough to get ahold of a couple of experienced diggers.
6838.94|6845.09|And they would dig all the holes we needed for a small outfit.
6847.52|6853.71|Then a little later, I found out they had another two-ton truck in Regina that the military was selling off.
6854.35|6857.35|I got these trucks for virtually nothing.
6857.37|6864.42|I got the Army trucks at about $350 a piece, and they were in mint condition.
6864.44|6865.92|And then I bought this other truck.
6865.94|6870.1|I think I paid $1,100 for it, and it was virtually like a new truck.
6871.59|6873.65|So I had pretty good equipment to start with,
6874.05|6877.11|just the three trucks, and these army trucks were open.
6877.13|6880.52|They didn't have cabs on them.
6880.54|6881.88|So you had to put up with that.
6884.22|6889.13|In their tough weather, you were sitting out in the open.
6889.15|6895.0|Well, then I... Let's see, I worked...
6895.08|6899.14|I finished that job dismantling those airports.
6899.16|6901.42|That was one hell of a job.
6901.44|6902.28|We uncovered...
6902.84|6909.55|miles and miles of cable that had been buried about two feet underground.
6910.87|6913.99|We were supposed to take it up without damaging it.
6914.01|6925.59|Well, I tried every method there was of uncovering that cable, from hand digging right up to getting graders and scraping it down until you got it, but
6927.0|6940.71|no way could you go and excavate a half a mile of cable without getting some damage in it; scraping it or digging - even when you're digging by hand you'd rub the shovel into it occasionally. So -
6941.34|6951.63|They told us take it out as best we could, and we still had to go through the process of making a trench and pulling the cable out and then filling the trench in again.
6952.90|6956.84|I could never figure out how three men,
6956.97|6966.17|three different contractors, could sit down and figure out how you dismantled those two airports, overhead lines, underground lines, and everything.
6967.69|6979.87|And then use all the usable material to build a power line, as I said, from Halbrite to Midale to Macoun.
6979.89|6984.75|And in the three - one - there were four bids!
6985.98|6990.31|In the four bids, there was only $1,000 difference from high to low.
6991.71|6993.85|I happened to be the low one.
6993.87|6999.55|It went all the way from my bid was $10,500 and the highest bid was $11,500.
7002.48|7008.62|But it - it was almost unbelievable to think that four men could sit down -
7008.64|7014.47|This was something that none of them had ever done before, or none of us had ever done before.
7014.99|7025.74|But we come in that close; that's within 10%, which - considered pretty close bidding at any time.
7025.8|7035.62|Well, worked in - I finished up in Mydale on that project about the end of November.
7038.0|7042.14|Then the Power Commission had some work they wanted done up on the north -
7042.98|7050.68|north suburb, what they called North Regina, everything north of the CN tracks.
7052.2|7064.44|So I come up and I worked on it through December and January and just had a small crew, I think, four men or so.
7064.46|7067.66|And then after that we went to Saskatoon and did a similar job.
7067.68|7069.89|This was for wartime housing.
7071.5|7074.39|And this was an experience now:
7074.43|7079.21|we were digging through frost, anywhere up to four or five foot of frost.
7081.65|7090.9|But somehow, well, in Saskatoon it was in sandy ground, you couldn't dig, so I had to put fire, burn the frost out.
7092.35|7095.79|And it all worked out pretty good.
7095.81|7099.33|You just did what you had to do, and that was it.
7101.63|7110.76|Then I came back and I did some work in the town of Davidson for the old Dominion Electric Company.
7110.78|7114.38|They were still functioning.
7114.4|7121.43|And then I went back to Estevan and just sat in quiet until the spring, when the tenders come out.
7123.79|7128.26|Then I got a... the first job was from Weyburn to Radville,
7128.95|7131.41|which was a nice job, and it was an early spring.
7131.43|7137.49|We were working on that early in April.
7137.51|7144.28|And from there on, you just kept on moving ahead.
7144.36|7149.71|When I got that job finished, they had a bunch of farms around Weyburn, I did those.
7153.61|7158.83|And then I went back to Estevan and started building the
7159.17|7162.52|big high voltage line, and that put something else too.
7162.74|7174.15|There you got - everything was so heavy and big and we had never dealt with cross arms and insulators and poles.
7174.76|7179.84|All the poles were 40 feet or more.
7179.82|7184.21|The cross arms were four by sixes, ten feet long.
7185.83|7188.02|You had to handle all that heavy stuff.
7188.88|7194.78|I still don't know how I was able to make a dollar on the job, but I did.
7197.19|7204.38|I finished - worked all summer, besides running out and doing other odd jobs.
7204.4|7207.94|That came up from time to time, and I finished that job on the
7209.03|7211.94|11th day of December.
7211.96|7213.64|We had all the wires drawn, and
7213.66|7214.6|it was heavy wire.
7215.04|7219.53|That was a new experience, too.
7219.55|7221.79|And then I folded up for the winter.
7235.47|7237.81|Now I'll relate
7239.54|7241.47|what I did for help - for men.
7244.53|7251.3|I got a hold of a fellow, he was a few years older than myself, that had been a lineman.
7251.32|7254.12|And he was uneducated.
7254.18|7257.67|He could hardly write his own name, but he was a good worker.
7258.85|7259.51|Good, honest -
7262.85|7270.49|On the last tape I started telling you what I had for a crew of men to start with.
7270.49|7274.36|I started out about Jack Gardner he was the first fellow I hired.
7275.81|7292.24|And, I picked up help. Young kids out of school, one thing another. We're just out staking line and getting material out and then later on, I rounded up some
7293.41|7297.21|fellows from Regina here that were experienced hole diggers.
7299.94|7302.26|Two of them in particular were professionals.
7304.12|7312.87|So we started digging the holes, and what have you, and then we - oh yeah, we had to get machinery then to set these poles.
7312.95|7316.27|This was the biggest poles that had ever been set in this province.
7317.41|7321.36|So I had the old army truck and I had a derrick
7321.76|7325.16|made for it, a 25-foot derrick.
7325.18|7329.03|And we could handle the poles quite nicely.
7329.13|7331.93|Once in a while, we'd get a heavy one that'd give us some trouble.
7333.67|7336.41|Well, anyway, in the meantime, I picked up Art Miller.
7336.69|7339.68|He was just a young fellow out of the Army looking for a job.
7341.8|7344.02|He was handy at driving trucks.
7344.52|7345.7|He was really good with trucks.
7346.94|7349.19|So that gave me the nucleus of a -
7349.79|7351.11|of an outfit.
7351.17|7355.94|We started setting poles, dropping the poles in the holes and hand tamping them.
7357.68|7360.9|Have five and six men tamping and two men shoveling.
7363.03|7370.62|And, oh, we'd set about twenty-five poles a day, maybe thirty on a good day.
7374.32|7378.65|And I worked that crew up - by the time I'd finished the Stoughton job,
7379.64|7385.95|I had twenty-five, thirty men working for me.
7385.97|7387.65|And again, no one with experience.
7389.77|7395.18|Until I come to string in the Wire, then I picked up a couple of fellows that had climbed poles in the Army.
7396.94|7400.74|That gave me three or four climbers, and with that we were able to get along.
7402.61|7403.49|Everything was new.
7403.53|7405.49|You had to figure out everything for yourself.
7405.51|7407.69|No one had ever
7408.19|7417.61|had the experience of doing a job of stringing a line under the cross arms.
7418.43|7419.71|Oh, I'll come back to that again.
7419.75|7429.62|Everybody wondered, "How can you string wire when the cross arms are on a slant and you can't lay the wire on them?"
7429.64|7430.66|Well, I went to Winnipeg.
7432.33|7436.09|I figured out if I got some hay pulleys, about four-inch pulleys,
7436.75|7439.07|big enough to take a three-quarter inch rope.
7441.41|7447.1|I went to Winnipeg, and I went to Ashdown Hardware, and I asked the guy, "Have you got any wooden hay pulleys?
7447.9|7451.84|Just the bare pulley I want."
7451.86|7452.08|"Yeah."
7452.62|7453.34|I said, "How many?"
7453.38|7454.92|He looked up his inventory.
7455.36|7456.15|He had 250.
7456.16|7458.15|I said, "I'll take them all."
7458.55|7463.19|The guy looked at me like I was out of my tree.
7463.21|7466.41|"What are you going to do with 250 wooden pulleys?"
7466.82|7469.48|So I said, "I've got a job for them.
7470.14|7470.66|Don't worry.
7470.88|7472.36|I'm not buying them just for fun."
7473.45|7478.21|However, I - we designed hangers for these pulleys.
7478.95|7480.62|They worked out 100%.
7480.76|7483.7|Today, they use a pulley to do the same job.
7483.76|7485.6|Of course, the conductors are heavier,
7486.04|7491.13|but the pulleys they use nowadays cost you probably $100, $150 a piece.
7491.51|7493.53|Those cost me about $0.35 a piece.
7494.65|7496.64|Well, plus the labor of assembly.
7498.15|7514.11|Well, anyway, that wound up the Stoughton job, and I finished that, as I remember, right on December the 9th, and then we folded up for the winter.
7514.25|7521.66|I'll start out, go year by year where we worked and what we did, and sort of run over it roughly.
7522.04|7523.82|There'd be so much detail
7526.12|7529.42|if I went into detail of what happened.
7529.44|7540.06|And all the men I went through, and the men I trained and everything. It would take hours and hours to tell it all.
7540.6|7550.52|Anyway, you've got to be in the mood for talking when you start telling stories about things that happened 40 years ago.
7552.22|7554.43|So we'll just wind her up for now.
7554.49|7556.55|I'm going to listen to Brian Mulroney.
7558.87|7565.46|I listened to Brian, and he didn't have much to say talking on trade with the United States.
7568.92|7571.59|He talked a lot, but he didn't say much, put it that way.
7574.15|7575.49|I'm sitting outside right now.
7575.61|7577.07|It's 88 degrees out here.
7577.11|7580.66|It's on Tuesday afternoon, May the...
7581.75|7582.49|17th.
7583.36|7585.58|June the 17th, not May.
7585.6|7587.04|June the 17th, yeah.
7589.86|7591.91|So I don't know what it's going to be like out here.
7591.95|7597.88|The wind is blowing or there may be some roaring in the mic on account of the wind.
7598.96|7601.72|I'll just take a shot of this and see what's happening.
7601.74|7606.53|I'll play it back now and see what this sounds like.
7608.2|7610.4|I played it back and it sounded all right.
7610.44|7616.85|There's no interference from the wind, so I'll go on talking about 1947 now.
7618.87|7630.57|1947, my first job was building a line from Weyburn to Radville and picking up the village of Trossachs on the way.
7631.23|7634.36|It was an early break up in the spring and we got an early start.
7635.03|7655.62|After we finished that job, we did about twenty farms just north of Weyburn, and from there I got a job building a line from Dinsmoor to Eston and up from Elrose to Rosetown.
7655.64|7664.53|That was about 110 miles of line, including about ten towns and villages that all needed new distribution.
7666.69|7675.64|So we got into that, oh, I would say, about mid-June when we started on that job.
7676.88|7687.49|Anyway, in the meantime, there had been a reunion organized with a family to meet down at Em's place in Oregon.
7689.07|7691.76|And I didn't know what to do.
7691.78|7693.62|I had so damn much work ahead of me.
7694.63|7696.93|So I happened to be going through Moose Jaw.
7697.01|7702.1|My old bank manager from Estevan, Bill Mullins, was the manager in Moose Jaw.
7702.68|7705.3|So I stopped in to say hello to him.
7705.32|7722.97|And of course, the conversation, I told him how much work I had ahead of me and that there was this reunion coming up where I was to meet eight of my brothers and three sisters.
7724.7|7730.31|I didn't know whether I should leave my job and go down there or what I should do.
7730.33|7739.06|He said, "Lindy," he said, "If I had eight brothers to meet, he said, I'd leave any kind of a job to go down there to the reunion."
7739.66|7741.94|He said, "The job will go along for two weeks.
7741.96|7743.68|They'll never miss you."
7743.78|7745.8|He said, "What difference it will make?"
7745.9|7748.19|He said, "You'll never miss."
7748.21|7753.17|So we went to the reunion, and it turned out to be a very good trip.
7753.88|7757.64|Bud and Ethel and Phyllis and I went down in one car.
7758.78|7760.65|And I had a new car at that time.
7761.31|7762.81|So we had really a nice trip.
7762.83|7765.74|We were gone two weeks.
7765.76|7767.74|And back to the job up at Elrose.
7770.34|7777.25|I no more than got that job underway when the superintendent come along and said they had a job
7778.78|7783.89|running from Canora, Saskatchewan, up to Preeceville, and over to Norquay.
7783.91|7789.58|That was about 60 or 70 miles of line.
7789.6|7795.16|It took in one, two, three, four, five towns to build in.
7796.91|7801.59|And God, there's no way that I could see that I could handle it.
7801.61|7803.15|And Ted Durnan was after me.
7803.17|7804.8|They had to get this done.
7805.4|7807.14|It was sort of a political thing.
7809.28|7828.87|So finally I made a deal with him that if he'd give me his boring machine, or rented me his boring machine to dig all the holes and set the poles, I figured I could rustle up the help to complete the job by the end of the year.
7831.67|7835.22|So I had the job at
7835.98|7840.74|Rosetown, Elrose pretty well underway, and Art Miller was able to take over it.
7840.76|7847.35|So I went to Canora and started that job, again without any help.
7847.71|7851.59|Just got my brother Zip to come out and help stake a line.
7852.09|7856.35|That's the first thing you have to do is stake a line.
7856.37|7864.9|And then we hired some local guys there to haul out the poles, and I got a couple of guys to start putting on the cross arms.
7865.62|7873.21|When we got the thing laid out, ready to go, then the power sent up their boring machine.
7873.23|7876.86|And we went ahead, and it was easy to organize a tamping crew.
7876.88|7884.1|You could get almost any farm laborer to work on that job.
7884.12|7894.01|Well, we got all the poles set by about, oh, I'd say we had the pole setting done
7895.34|7903.97|by about the end of October, in the towns and on the high line and everything, there was an awful lot of bush to cut up in that country.
7903.99|7913.69|I had to hire men with axes to go in and slash a 25-foot swath through sometimes, a quarter mile of solid trees.
7914.11|7917.8|Oh, the trees up to five, six inches in diameter.
7917.82|7922.88|And that all had to be piled and put out of the way.
7923.22|7930.85|Then I was jockeying back and forth between that job and the one over at Dinsmoor, trying to get them both cleaned up before winter.
7933.03|7935.95|And time was running out on both ends.
7935.97|7946.94|So finally, I went over to Dins - to Rosetown, Elrose, and stayed on that job to push the wire stringing.
7946.96|7948.89|And they weren't going as fast as they should.
7949.87|7953.09|And we had to get somebody to string the wires in the towns and I
7953.51|7958.04|sublet some of that to local guys that could climb poles.
7960.5|7968.68|And then I - when I left the Canora job, left Jack Gardner in charge.
7968.74|7970.64|Well, Jack was the first guy I ever hired.
7971.44|7973.91|I think I mentioned before, a hell of a good man.
7974.81|7978.67|But if you gave him more than two helpers,
7979.92|7985.03|he became confused, and he would do all the work, and the guys would all stand there and watch him.
7986.94|7990.09|Well, I left Jack there. He was to start string and wire.
7990.11|7991.89|Now, he knew all about string and wire.
7994.44|8005.01|When I came back on the job about the 20th of November, and my God, he only had three miles of wire strung.
8005.03|8008.9|Well, I shouldn't say that, about six miles of wire strung, and he had been fiddling away for
8009.5|8010.24|ten days.
8012.88|8019.13|Well, I got so God darn mad, I went out there - and he had a crew of thirteen men.
8019.15|8025.18|I went out there and the first guy I'd see that didn't have something definite to do, I said, "You're finished tonight."
8025.98|8030.48|I paired the crew down to eight men and then we started stringing three miles of wire every day.
8031.65|8034.11|We got organized and really got going.
8036.59|8037.97|Well, I finished that job.
8040.35|8047.22|Hooked up the last town the day before Christmas.
8047.24|8056.01|Well, oh yeah, it was a weekend came in there, and I wanted my crew to work on Sunday, that we could get everything finished.
8056.05|8061.78|But they got into the beer parlour Saturday night, and Sunday morning you couldn't get any of them out.
8062.8|8068.87|So I got Jack Gardner and myself and two ground men, both experienced ground men.
8069.66|8073.98|We went out and we did more work on the Sunday than the whole damned outfit would do.
8075.53|8078.41|And we got the town ...
8079.83|8081.49|That was the last town, the - Sturgis.
8082.99|8086.58|And Durnan had told me they had an old and broken down plant in Sturgis.
8086.6|8092.86|He said, "You've got to get Sturgis going before you come back in for Christmas."
8092.88|8094.16|So I worked all Sunday,
8094.2|8098.89|and about Sunday night, about 11 o'clock, I got in the car
8100.31|8101.65|and headed for Regina.
8102.01|8105.07|Well, that was about a four-hour drive.
8106.61|8109.34|Anyway, I got home about 3 o'clock in the morning.
8109.36|8114.72|The heater on my car failed during the way in, so I had to drive in in a cold car.
8117.63|8118.65|I got mad at the crew.
8118.73|8125.7|Payday came, and I said, "I'm not paying you guys until payday, and that - we'd be in Regina on that day."
8127.12|8128.96|Well after work on that day,
8130.36|8132.76|they all laid around the hotel all day Sunday,
8134.1|8142.32|caught the train Monday, got in here Monday - yeah, late Monday night.
8144.82|8148.9|I went down to the station and met them and gave them their paychecks.
8148.92|8149.93|Monday was payday.
8151.93|8152.97|I laughed at them.
8153.09|8154.81|I said, "You guys were so smart.
8155.21|8159.76|You missed a day's work, and now you come in a day late for pay." I said.
8161.22|8163.55|Let that be a lesson to you for the future.
8164.35|8167.91|Well, I don't know if it taught them anything.
8167.93|8169.77|Most of those fellows were come and go.
8172.72|8177.45|Well, that wound up our season for 1947.
8177.53|8180.99|Oh, yes, the Elrose job, they didn't get it quite completed.
8181.67|8187.4|They were still finishing things up there in January, and then we shut down until spring.
8189.52|8195.61|Now, in '48, I have to stop and think.
8195.63|8197.91|In 1948, where did we start?
8200.25|8201.5|In 1948.
8207.8|8212.91|I really have to scratch my head to see where we started.
8212.93|8219.82|In '48, yeah -
8221.77|8223.72|Oh, I think I didn't get in on the early bidding.
8224.17|8224.71|That's right.
8224.77|8226.71|I lost out on all the jobs.
8226.73|8238.2|And finally, they came along and they had a job out north of Swift Current, system to put there.
8238.22|8240.77|And I got going on that about in June.
8242.19|8244.63|Oh yeah, I went and built a line to Cypress Park.
8244.67|8246.07|That's where I started.
8246.39|8258.29|From Maple Creek to Cypress Park, and then went north of town to Mendham and Leader up in there, and we were building in a bunch of farms and whatnot.
8258.31|8261.93|Then come back down and worked around Swift Current.
8264.92|8278.14|Did a bunch of Mennonite settlements there, and then down and put a line from Vanguard to Aneroid.
8281.51|8289.48|And after that, we had 200 farms to go down at Oxbow.
8289.5|8295.7|That was the first year we got a big group of farms.
8295.78|8299.43|And we had that all finished and had a full season, a good season.
8299.59|8300.91|Made good money that year.
8300.97|8302.17|The weather was good.
8302.21|8303.04|Everything went fine
8303.50|8307.56|and we finished all our rurals by Christmas time.
8307.58|8318.59|Then I come to the city, and the city, the head guy for the city knew me, and he said, "They had some poles to set in the city."
8318.67|8327.98|So I started setting poles in the city, working by the hour, just so much an hour for men and equipment.
8328.0|8331.52|And the first thing I knew, I had half a dozen men going all winter.
8332.47|8333.17|I never stopped.
8335.12|8340.91|And that was the start of a 10-year stint with the city of Regina.
8342.49|8346.33|They asked me for a price for rental of the equipment and wages.
8347.39|8355.18|So I gave them rental rates on the equipment and wages plus 10% onto the payroll.
8358.37|8359.11|And that was it.
8360.97|8364.87|That went on for 10 years without any -
8365.14|8374.38|I just wrote them - submitted them a letter, a proposal that I would work for this, and it just kept going and going as wages went up while I charged them the more wages.
8375.12|8377.98|But the equipment rental, I never changed into the ten years.
8378.14|8388.72|I was an inflation fighter, and it was a good deal for me because we always left our poorest equipment in town here because there wasn't that much for it to do.
8388.74|8390.12|It was standing around mostly.
8391.06|8395.53|Boring machines that bore an average of about eight or ten holes a day were out in the country.
8395.55|8405.24|They had to bore anywhere 50, 60, 70, or 80 holes a day.
8405.26|8406.92|Well, that was 1948.
8409.65|8420.01|And in '49, I went to - oh yeah, I got the piece of high voltage line, the 72,000 from Killaly,
8420.9|8425.58|that's up near Melville, up to Yorkton.
8425.6|8429.27|I moved in on it just about - just before harvest,
8429.29|8431.23|I got in on it.
8431.25|8439.74|Previous to that, in '49, I can't recollect where we were working.
8439.76|8441.34|But nevertheless, we were busy.
8443.19|8447.69|We had some project somewhere, and I had a pretty good crew organized.
8448.75|8449.76|Then we went into
8450.06|8455.8|to do that line up from Yorktown to Melville and down to Killaly, another 18 miles.
8457.48|8459.64|And that had to be completed by wintertime.
8460.83|8462.23|Well, everything went fine.
8463.69|8470.61|We got the poles up, and we got about half of the wires strung when it came into the first part of December.
8472.08|8475.06|And it stormed, and the snow kept piling in.
8475.08|8479.1|I built a snow pile in front of my big Army truck,
8480.26|8484.13|We'd open up a road, and the next day it would blow in again.
8484.15|8484.63|We kept that up.
8484.63|8491.92|One week, we opened the road three times and never put a truck over it.
8491.94|8493.74|Well, we were virtually stalled.
8493.76|8497.89|It kept on snowing and storming.
8497.91|8501.94|So the Power Corporation said, "Well, we - we're not ready to use that line anyway.
8501.96|8503.86|We haven't got the transformers or anything."
8503.88|8505.76|So I shut her down until spring,
8507.53|8509.37|and then went back up and finished it.
8509.39|8511.78|That was the spring of '50.
8511.8|8522.57|Finished the wire stringing in some substations in Yorkton and Melville.
8525.13|8531.34|Then I went down and I built 18 miles of line from Stockholm to Esterhazy.
8534.84|8540.44|After, we're talking, 1949, yeah.
8544.38|8547.53|Oh yeah, then we had a bunch of farms to do in '49.
8550.23|8553.48|That was another thing that was just coming on stream was farm electrification.
8553.5|8561.82|So we got some farm jobs, units of 40 or 50 farms to a unit.
8561.84|8568.47|We did probably 100 farms that year, and then shut down for the winter again.
8570.26|8579.71|And in '50, I started out - built a line from Yorkton to Theodore.
8580.01|8584.98|From there, moved down to - oh, I forgot to tell you, in '49.
8587.04|8597.72|Yeah, after we finished up that line, then I got a job 30 miles from Yorkton to Canora.
8599.0|8600.68|And that was a good straightforward job.
8600.7|8601.88|We did that up in a hurry
8601.94|8614.68|and then, out of work by the end of October, so I got a job up in Alberta.
8615.3|8616.88|Went up to Alberta, that's right.
8616.9|8621.15|Built in a bunch of farms up around Lloydminster and Vegreville.
8622.47|8627.4|Maybe did about 70 or 80 farms up in there.
8627.96|8628.92|Stayed there until
8629.28|8634.34|the end of the season. We wound up by Christmas time, shut her down for the winter.
8635.92|8637.50|That was in '49, yeah.
8637.50|8653.82|Then in '50, I started out. Built that line from Yorkton to Theodore and from there, Lampman to Bienfait, that was another 18 miles.
8655.05|8658.94|From there down to Shaunavon to Eastend, that was 30 miles.
8663.2|8669.43|And then after that, came in and went from Montmartre to Kipling.
8669.49|8671.14|That was about 60 miles.
8673.18|8676.58|So we had - pretty well had a full season and a good season.
8676.7|8684.45|I'd made good money and was satisfied with the equipment. Ted Durnan come along and said, "Gus Branders is in trouble with the line
8684.67|8692.8|down at Ogema and Assiniboia countries, bit off more than he can chew, and I want you to go down there and help him out."
8694.3|8697.47|Well. He said, "Come on down and look at it."
8697.49|8703.23|So I got in the car and went down there, and he went in the Branders' trailer,
8703.23|8713.41|and he was in there 3 hours arguing with him, and he wanted me to give him a hand on that line, because it had to be done before winter set in.
8714.88|8725.45|And I'm sitting out in the car, and Durnan's in there arguing why he was going to take some of it away and give it to me -
8728.05|8732.76|me and another contractor, we were going to set the poles jointly, then we'd string the wire.
8732.78|8737.61|And, oh, Branders gone mad at me over that one.
8737.63|8738.49|He blamed me,
8738.94|8741.1|you know, for the whole thing.
8741.72|8743.31|And I said, "You better find out the facts."
8743.33|8745.11|I said, "How I fought against that."
8745.13|8746.89|I said, "I had finished a good season."
8749.19|8754.16|And now I, now I - Durnan puts the gun to my head and says, "You got to come out and do that.
8754.24|8757.42|And I'm, I'm commissioning you to do it.
8758.18|8759.21|You can't say no."
8760.41|8768.34|Well, then when we finished that, went outside of Regina here, just south of Regina, and did a bunch of, of farms,
8768.64|8772.3|maybe about 15 or 20 farms, just south of Regina.
8772.32|8777.89|So we were going till Christmas time, and then shut down for the winter again.
8777.91|8784.14|I said that was in '50? 50, 50.
8786.01|8788.87|Yeah, then '51, then I got a whole bunch of line.
8788.89|8795.94|I had about 300 miles of cross-arm line to build, besides all kinds of farms.
8795.96|8798.44|It was in the Sha - Ogema, Bengough,
8799.01|8809.61|Viceroy, down to Rockglen, Coronach, all in through that country.
8809.63|8817.14|Up north from Kyle to Elrose, and we did about 50 farms up in there, plus 7 or 8 towns.
8818.48|8823.34|Big season that was in '51.
8823.36|8824.57|'52 was a short season.
8827.63|8836.83|There again, we didn't start very early, didn't get any work, but always had this crew in the city, kept my basic crew.
8837.17|8843.44|I could always work them in the city here, never out of work.
8843.46|8847.18|And then '52 - and then the farms started picking up.
8847.2|8849.67|Yeah, we were doing farm projects all over the place.
8850.55|8854.0|Maybe did 250 or 300 farms that year.
8857.86|8858.6|That's '52.
8859.34|8863.02|Now, I'll just slow down for a minute here.
8863.06|8864.84|Take a rest while I think this over.
8868.03|8871.87|Now we're at '53.
8871.89|8876.15|'53 was mostly all rural farms.
8876.17|8879.52|We did about 385 or 390 farms that year.
8881.02|8885.28|And we had a well-organized operation by this time on farms.
8886.21|8890.23|You went out and you did an average of five miles a line every day.
8890.27|8891.79|That meant five farms.
8893.62|8899.85|It meant that it involved setting about 75 or 80 poles.
8901.69|8911.0|And about - that would, 75 or 80 poles would involve about 30 anchors.
8912.26|8919.71|And, of course, the transformers and everything on them, we had to complete the operation ready to throw on the switch, which we usually did before we left.
8922.11|8922.65|And that was in '53.
8922.67|8926.34|'53 is a good year all the way around.
8926.4|8930.7|Again, we were still operating in town here all the time.
8930.98|8932.08|The city was expanding.
8932.12|8940.41|We built all the pole lines in Regina from Campion College south, and every suburb that went in after that.
8940.88|8942.46|We did all the pole lines on them.
8945.57|8947.39|That was a sort of a bread and butter thing.
8949.03|8949.43|That's '53.
8949.85|8950.57|I just finished.
8950.66|8951.74|OK, '54.
8952.5|8954.94|More farms.
8954.96|8967.4|All the way from, you can say, from Maple Creek to the west to -
8969.69|8978.58|Well, we never got as far as the Manitoba border, about Kipling to the east, and everything - always south of the valley, south of the Saskatchewan River and the Qu'Appelle Valley.
8979.97|8980.47|It was '54.
8980.83|8984.17|We did about 450 farms.
8984.71|8990.7|And '55, well, we did some towns and villages in that, too.
8990.72|8992.35|'55 was more farms again.
8992.41|8995.17|Then we went up to about 475 farms.
8996.57|8998.01|And this was all on a set price.
8998.07|9007.9|The price had been established back in, when, '50 - '48 or '50, somewhere in there, had been established.
9007.92|9012.53|So much a pole, so much an anchor, and so much a transformer.
9012.55|9017.11|Just the three items is all you had to bid on and that covered everything.
9017.17|9021.83|You had to do your own bushing and hauling your material and everything.
9024.38|9026.26|Well, '55, another big run.
9026.3|9027.86|We went right up till Christmas time.
9027.92|9035.1|Had snow, about six inches of snow, but the weather was beautiful right up till Christmas time.
9035.11|9038.54|We wound up, again, '56 more farms.
9038.6|9041.3|And it went up to about 450 farms in '56.
9044.49|9051.86|And occasionally there would come a chunk of high voltage line in with it.
9051.88|9052.38|And,
9053.61|9065.0|'57 now the farm operation the big units of 40 and 50 farms are pretty well all done. We're doing a scattered filling -
9066.14|9067.56|On tape 6.
9068.92|9073.77|And I just finished saying that we were - in '57, we were filling in farms.
9073.81|9078.12|I set up three three-man crews, and each one was on their own.
9078.16|9088.61|They'd haul their poles - stake their line, haul their poles, set the poles, string the wire, and connect them, hot, ready to go.
9089.96|9092.64|And then, well, we did pretty well.
9092.7|9094.54|We had a nice turnover that year.
9095.28|9098.95|This was a hard job to keep track of, though.
9099.01|9101.35|Your men are on the move all the time, so much paperwork.
9101.99|9116.58|I forgot to mention, when a crew went out to do a job, you had to supply them with about five sets of blueprints so that everybody working on the job had a blueprint and knew where the line was going, what to do, etc.
9118.17|9121.73|And that was '57.
9121.91|9124.44|'58, I got totally bit out.
9124.46|9125.96|I didn't get any work.
9127.52|9128.22|'58.
9130.04|9137.58|And then I just hung around, and pretty soon they come along, and I had my city crew going, and pretty soon they come along.
9137.6|9142.34|They had a little job here and a little job there, and when the dust was all settled, I had a pretty fair season.
9142.62|9143.79|Turned over a profit,
9144.91|9147.57|in spite of being bid right out.
9147.62|9151.44|Everybody by that time - the work was getting more scarce and everybody was bidding down.
9151.46|9154.46|I refused to bid below my costs.
9154.48|9158.45|I knew what my costs were and I stayed with that.
9158.79|9160.45|In '59, what did we do in 59?
9162.77|9168.69|I have to think hard now.
9168.71|9169.22|'59, '59.
9169.44|9172.66|Pause.
9173.63|9175.7|Yeah, '59 was not a big year.
9175.96|9179.5|It was - but a profitable one.
9179.72|9182.04|I'm short of profit at the end of the year.
9182.82|9187.15|Then it come along '60 and I build - then I got quite a bit of line in '60.
9187.27|9202.75|I was building a bunch of farms and 60 miles of high line north of Regina starting up at Bulyea, and running all the way, well 60 miles north and doing all the towns
9203.2|9205.24|up through there, rebuilding the towns.
9205.68|9206.98|Oh, yeah, and we had a salvage.
9207.2|9212.43|The old line, which had been built in 1928, we had a salvage 60 miles a line.
9212.45|9217.47|And that was - well, that's as much work as building a line when it comes right down to it.
9217.49|9224.48|So that looked like 120 miles a line that took the best part of the summer for a medium-sized crew.
9224.5|9225.58|It didn't have a big crew.
9227.33|9229.77|And that completed '59.
9229.81|9233.17|Again, we had a good year.
9233.81|9242.85|'60 another one of those years where it was a little work here, and a little work there.
9242.85|9249.79|And much of this work I didn't have to bid on, I'd just submit a price to them and they'd say go out and do that job.
9249.79|9254.64|And,we were experienced enough that we could take on almost anything.
9255.13|9258.67|We built some H frame line in '60. 
9258.67|9275.86|Then in '61, Rags Johnson and ourselves jointly bid on a piece of high-voltage line from Shellbrook to Prince Albert, which had a river crossing in it, which was always a big job.
9275.86|9280.53|A river crossing was always a big job.
9280.55|9282.69|It involved -
9282.71|9291.32|It would probably cost you, at that time, $8,000 or $10,000 to cross, just to cross for the river crossing itself.
9291.94|9293.27|We worked on that job.
9293.31|9299.82|And after it was finished, again, it was going around doing odds and ends, nothing -
9300.76|9304.78|The farm electrification by this time was pretty well finished up.
9304.8|9311.41|So you didn't - you didn't go out and do these projects with 40 and 50 farms on them.
9312.33|9316.18|You had to be mobile and scattered all over the place.
9317.27|9322.90|That was '61, and '62 was about the same thing again.
9323.81|9340.17|Then '63. Trying to think, in '63 - as the later years come come in it's harder for me to remember what the hell we were doing. And -
9344.85|9349.33|However by this time we're finished in the city here. This this was petered out.
9349.33|9351.37|But there were other things showing up.
9351.37|9356.79|Oh yes, the potash mine out here at Kalium, just out of Regina.
9356.79|9370.24|We got all their work. No matter what they had to do they called us in, not only on building it but on on design, you know what they should - they didn't have engineers that were familiar with line work at all, so you got in on the design end of it.
9371.66|9374.65|And we - oh yeah, potash mines were coming in.
9374.71|9381.66|We did quite a lot of work around the potash mines, running in lines here and there for the potash mines.
9381.82|9383.48|That was '63 and '64.
9384.51|9387.51|And '65 was my last year.
9388.43|9392.06|We got a big project out at Swift Current.
9392.08|9394.99|Well, big in those days, in dollars and cents
9396.28|9403.95|as I remember it, it was something - the one job, I think maybe the biggest job in dollar and cents that I had ever undertaken,
9405.09|9406.93|it was $125,000 or $30,000.
9406.95|9411.78|And then there was, you know, a lot of extras came in.
9411.8|9414.84|By the time I wound up, it was about $150,000.
9415.44|9423.39|But that turned out to be a bad, bad season on a price that everybody said, what a hell of a price you got for that.
9423.72|9428.55|Well, it started raining, and by God, it kept on raining in that dried-out country.
9429.91|9431.39|And there's no place by this time.
9431.47|9433.44|It's getting tough to get people in there.
9433.82|9437.1|Oil had come in, and every place was taken up with oil then.
9438.22|9446.01|So I bought an old camping outfit from the Power Corporation, cook car and two bunk cars,
9446.49|9449.26|that could handle about 20 or 25 men.
9449.46|9453.42|And then I got an outfit from Edmonton to come down and -
9454.16|9456.19|and look after it - to do the cooking.
9456.93|9459.13|It cost us $18 a day per man.
9460.49|9461.73|And I furnished the camp.
9463.68|9472.09|And when that job was finished, the job that everybody thought I was going to make so much money on, in the winter I said to Art, "Go over that job."
9472.17|9474.99|I said, "You followed it all, all the way through.
9475.61|9482.92|Go through the files and pick up every dollar of expense we had on that job and tell me how much money we made on it."
9483.63|9491.3|And when the dust was settled, figuring our overhead - our office overhead and everything on that job, we had come up with 6% net.
9491.44|9495.56|That's about as low as you dare go and not lose money.
9496.6|9498.25|But that's what can happen with weather.
9498.85|9504.59|We were rained out for 30 days that summer that we couldn't go out and work at all.
9504.63|9509.08|And then for that 30 days, you can figure there's another 30 days that you're out there
9509.97|9513.17|messing around in the mud when you should be sitting at home -
9514.14|9518.72|you're out there messing around and getting nothing done, but you're trying.
9520.8|9522.31|And that was my last season.
9522.33|9528.11|When that job was wound up then, that was the end of it for L.H.A.
9530.1|9535.89|And on the last day of the year, I turned the outfit over and sold it to
9536.71|9543.8|Art, Bill, George, and Vaughn.
9545.24|9552.99|With Art - they set up a company, Achen '65 Limited, and Art was the 51% shareholder.
9555.12|9565.17|And they went ahead, and they've never looked back in, what is it, this is the 21st year now.
9565.19|9569.66|And they've never been out of work, I suppose.
9570.3|9575.58|In the years that Art run the outfit, I never saw his books and never asked him.
9575.6|9580.27|But judging from the way prices went, everything, the Power started getting out of it.
9580.29|9591.16|They found out it cost them too damn much to build lines, and they were contracting the big jobs of a million dollars and a million and a half dollars at a shot.
9591.18|9598.09|And the boys got in on that, and I'm sure come out with some nice profits.
9599.74|9601.85|However, that's all beside the point.
9602.01|9605.09|I never regretted having stepped out when I did.
9607.46|9612.48|Never regretted for one minute that they - the things were good.
9612.6|9613.88|That's one thing I said to him.
9613.94|9624.01|"Look," I said, "Right now it looks better for the contractor than it ever did, because the power the unions got them so -
9624.45|9629.5|so backed up to the wall if they're almost afraid to go out and do anything themselves.
9630.72|9633.76|And there'd be more contracting than ever, and how right I was.
9633.9|9639.95|But I said, "You saw me burn myself out here in 18 years," and I said, "I'm finished.
9640.87|9642.03|I don't want any more."
9642.31|9645.74|Well, not 18 years, that's 20 years.
9645.76|9653.22|And I got out, and I wouldn't be alive today if I'd have stayed in there and tried to run it.
9653.68|9655.82|I got out, I sold, I gave them a good deal.
9655.84|9657.56|I never regretted that.
9658.44|9663.95|I go down to the office and I'm treated like if I still owned and run the company.
9665.07|9668.89|And many of the men are still around there that had worked for me.
9669.39|9671.85|Many - Ernie Smith is the oldest now.
9671.89|9676.08|He's been there about 26, 27, and 30 years, somewhere in there.
9677.92|9683.46|Yeah, it's 55 -
9683.78|9686.72|30 - He'd been there 32 or 33 years.
9689.03|9695.18|And George Jenny quit and went farming. He called in here the other night to say hello to me see how we're getting along.
9695.18|9703.52|He said, he - the 20 years he spent with Achen Construction he said he couldn't have worked a better place or learned more than he did in the years he was there.
9704.71|9708.89|Ron Kennedy, as you know got - was electrocuted at Moose Jaw.
9709.77|9712.53|Bill Zaharachuk died of a heart attack
9713.63|9715.52|just when things were really going good.
9717.06|9721.06|So Art took on another partner, Doug McGillivray.
9721.86|9722.48|He bought in.
9724.97|9734.8|And then Con Bandy, another guy that started working for me in '63, or '62, somewhere in there.
9735.32|9737.4|He bought in, but he's dropped out again.
9737.44|9741.39|So Art is back running the outfit - or with the shares.
9741.41|9742.63|He sold his shares.
9743.44|9748.08|to these fellas, or they had options to purchase shares and take over the company.
9748.46|9750.38|And I don't know, I never dig into it.
9750.5|9761.02|I always figure it's none of my business, and if Art wants to tell me, he'll tell me, and he don't talk much, as the saying goes.
9762.34|9769.41|So on the basis of that, I'm gonna cut her off right now and roll this back and see what I've said.
9770.67|9776.72|I'll use up the rest of this tape just in generalizing some of the things that took place.
9779.94|9783.45|This is July the 21st, 1986.
9788.56|9798.77|Ben and Leslie were here from June the 27th and just left yesterday, so I put the taping aside while they were here.
9799.61|9804.5|I didn't want to get things mixed up any worse than what I have them.
9804.52|9812.09|And we enjoyed having them at any rate.
9812.11|9812.91|They're good company.
9813.05|9816.92|They had a lot of fun entertaining themselves out in the pool.
9820.66|9827.71|Now I'll go back and give you a few things about
9828.64|9832.49|my life in the electrical field.
9834.12|9836.38|It was a hectic time,
9835.81|9843.24|saw it all grow from year to year, something new -
9843.7|9847.0|Every day, you might say, was different.
9847.02|9848.13|No two days alike.
9848.71|9856.62|Never went to work one day, but when I was looking forward to the challenge of the day that might come up, you never knew what might happen.
9857.56|9869.13|My years with the companies in the States, where I worked for three different companies, a great experience working with different people, different foremen.
9869.32|9875.4|I had about five or six foremen in those two years, and you learned something from each of them.
9876.38|9882.47|So when my day came to take charge, you try to put into effect
9883.58|9892.5|the good things, the good points that they had, and I think it probably helped me a lot in my years of handling men.
9892.84|9911.68|That you - that was the biggest thing about contracting was having your men work for you, whether you were there or not, that they liked you, they liked your attitude and what have you, and they worked.
9911.97|9913.93|And that's where you got production.
9914.03|9918.15|Production worked into dollars and cents.
9919.35|9931.07|And when I had 40, 50 men working for me, they all called me by my first name.
9931.15|9933.08|I didn't want to be Mr. Achen amongst them.
9933.18|9934.62|I - just Lindy to them.
9934.64|9937.62|And I think that goes a long ways.
9938.22|9939.53|You can do it in a small outfit.
9939.91|9943.31|You can't do it in a big outfit.
9943.33|9955.32|If you get big, then you lose contact with the people that are actually making you the money, the guys that are doing the work.
9964.14|9974.67|Well, If you look at my whole career, it was a pretty hectic one.
9975.33|9982.68|I started out digging holes, and from there worked up to being a lineman.
9984.0|9987.56|And I got to be a professional lineman, a hotline.
9987.62|9989.08|There was nothing I couldn't do.
9990.5|9993.85|And then into service, or into running a crew.
9995.93|9999.21|That was always an important job, to be the foreman on the crew.
9999.78|10004.29|And then from there I went into service work.
10004.39|10008.33|I learned how to read meters and how to serve customers.
10010.61|10015.8|Along with that, the years in Estevan were really good educational years.
10016.48|10018.8|You had to deal with absolutely everything.
10018.86|10024.36|I got acquainted with the transformers.
10024.4|10028.61|We used to rewind our own transformers, repair our own transformers,
10029.91|10037.11|which not many men in the business that had the experience that I had had that opportunity.
10037.95|10041.32|You get to be a lineman, that's all you knew, was be a lineman.
10041.38|10048.31|You didn't know anything about transformers or instruments or switchboards or power plants or anything.
10048.99|10050.73|Well, I've gone through all of this.
10051.54|10056.2|In my years in Estevan - when I left Estevan, I could have written steam papers.
10056.28|10068.95|I knew enough about a steam plant, having been associated with one, a small outfit again, where you - when there's trouble, you went down and helped out, and you talked to people, and you got knowledgeable about a steam plant.
10070.51|10076.17|Then from that, I went in and I operated a diesel plant.
10076.85|10081.16|Well, my knowledge in a diesel plant, it was only a one-cylinder engine, but if you got
10081.37|10085.02|a six-cylinder engine, it's the same thing, only six times as big, that's all.
10088.76|10091.88|I was in the instrument end.
10091.94|10093.19|I could calibrate meters.
10093.21|10096.49|I could calibrate switchboard instruments.
10096.51|10101.67|I knew all about a switchboard and the workings of it in a power plant.
10101.69|10110.28|And all knowledge that you gathered, put on the back shelf, and maybe someday you would use it;
10111.02|10123.28|and I did; All through the years that I was contracting things turned up where I could - where I might even be called in to say "We've got a problem here. Can you help us?"
10123.15|10143.67|And many times the power people called me and they wouldn't have anybody in the area that was capable of diagnosing a trouble or something, and those are some of the benefits you got through your wide experience in the business.
10146.50|10153.87|Yeah when you're a serviceman you had to collect money, you had to take care of complaint, you had to do everything, you got to know -
10153.87|10159.04|I had 1200 customers in Estevan and I knew every one of them and they all knew me.
10159.99|10167.34|And, in the minefields got a great knowledge of mining, both underground and strip mining
10169.01|10175.01|having served the field - for seven years I was in there.
10176.47|10178.18|It was a hectic life, yeah.
10178.38|10182.76|You worked - you were on call 30 days a month and 24 hours a day.
10183.0|10188.93|You were never paid overtime or anything, but you were proud as hell that you had a job, and you knew you could do it.
10189.43|10196.63|When the whistle blew, you went out and answered the call and didn't sit back and figure, "Well, how many hours can I get out of this?" or anything.
10196.63|10203.98|You'd go out and find the trouble and repair it and get back home and get to bed, finish your sleep so that you could go to work in the morning.
10205.72|10208.13|And that's the way it went from one thing to the other.
10214.27|10228.84|I think I related earlier that I had started doing some inside wiring way back in 1931.
10228.84|10233.29|At the time I built the power system into the village of Midale.
10234.25|10249.65|Well later on then, things got slack and I continued to work, and I kept on wiring and wiring and finally the wiring inspector said, "Why don't you write your journeyman's paper?"
10249.65|10253.21|So I wrote my journeyman's paper and I think I related to that earlier
10254.51|10259.48|I was so darn tickled when I got it because I didn't think I made the exams.
10260.62|10261.82|I still carry it today.
10263.24|10274.06|And it - while I really never did much wiring, there wasn't anything about it that I didn't know or couldn't sit down and figure out.
10276.0|10279.15|And it was something to have that journeyman's paper in your hip pocket.
10279.19|10283.24|The one I have now will run until I think it's 1990
10283.65|10285.08|before it expires.
10285.86|10287.5|I probably won't be around here.
10288.32|10290.02|And the company still keeps me on.
10290.1|10299.19|Art Miller's company still keeps me on pay on the small retainer, because I have that journeyman's paper. And some of the work that they run into from time to time,
10299.23|10302.18|they're supposed to have a journeyman electrician on the job.
10302.98|10307.16|Whether he does any work or not, that's another thing.
10307.52|10314.14|So therefore, they keep me available in case something turns up where they need a journeyman, and I'm there.
10316.15|10328.7|And all very interesting, you know, to be able to walk in and see an electrical layout, know what it's all about, not a puzzle or anything.
10330.6|10334.59|To the average layman it is, but it's just as simple as ABC when you
10335.49|10337.9|know how, what the principles of it are.
10338.86|10348.73|As far as being a technician is concerned, you give me this little tape recorder here and I can't even tell you what makes it work, or telephones or anything.
10348.75|10350.51|That was completely out of my line.
10350.53|10352.03|The radio was out of my line.
10352.53|10360.52|But my life was get the electricity from the generator to the
10360.94|10384.64|output work was going to be used that was always the big thing that's what I specialized in however i'm i'm glad it's all over I had one heck of a life in the electrical field I got to be pretty well known in saskatchewan and uh
10385.66|10388.67|Now they're all dying off.
10388.77|10390.97|I'm one of the older guys in the businesses.
10392.37|10406.71|I doubt if there's maybe two or three fellows in the whole province of my age that are still living that have gone through the business from one end to the other or for a period of 35, 40 years.
10409.42|10411.62|So I would say to anyone,
10414.4|10443.3|it's an exciting life the life of service is what you're in service is what you're selling when I was a contractor I was selling service and I still say, like my George Jenny, the fellow that worked for me, said, "If I had a son I'd want him to go and work for an outfit just like yours," he said, "Not too big"
10443.7|10447.18|where you get to know everything about everything," he said.
10447.84|10452.71|The knowledge I got there and the 20 years I worked there, he said, "Are just unbelievable."
10453.83|10461.46|He had worked from a boy on the end of a digging bar up to becoming a journeyman lineman.
10461.48|10462.46|He had a real good one.
10464.22|10470.57|And then he had saved his money, and when he got enough money to buy a farm, he bought the farm and said,
10471.1|10474.79|"Now I'm going to semi-retire, and that's what he's doing, really enjoying life."
10479.99|10486.68|I don't know if I mentioned anywhere along the money end of this business.
10488.42|10500.42|When I started working in Worthington, Iowa, we were working nine hours a day, and I got 35 cents an hour, paid my own room and board, drove a car,
10501.43|10507.27|Model T Ford Coupe.
10507.29|10511.16|The foreman came along one day after I'd been there about three weeks.
10512.44|10514.58|He said, "I like the way you work."
10514.6|10522.03|He said, " I put in an application for a raise to 40 cents an hour, and the head office turned it down."
10525.52|10529.56|But he said, "I'm going to plug your time enough to bring it up to 40 cents an hour."
10531.04|10536.27|That's when I was a groundman, digging holes and doing anything on the ground.
10537.55|10555.69|Then when I got to be a lineman, my wages stayed the same, but I was only there for about a month, and I left, I think I told you earlier in the story, when I quit in Nebraska and went up to work for my brother Lorry, who was sick at Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
10558.03|10560.37|Then when I started work the next time, I was up at
10560.69|10562.39|near Aberdeen, South Dakota.
10564.42|10568.12|And I started as a second-class lineman.
10568.16|10569.98|I was getting 45 cents an hour.
10571.28|10589.04|Being a lineman, my wages stayed the same, but I was only there for about a month, and I left, I think I told you earlier in the story, when I quit in Nebraska and went up to work for my brother, Lorry, who was sick at Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
10591.1|10595.54|Then when I started work the next time, I was up near Aberdeen, South Dakota.
10597.61|10601.33|And I started as a second-class lineman.
10601.35|10603.17|I was getting 45 cents an hour.
10608.1|10611.92|And they paid our room and board up to $3 a day.
10612.34|10616.26|Well, you could live on $3 a day quite handy in those days.
10616.28|10617.99|So now I was getting...
10618.27|10621.05|There was no income tax deductions or anything at that time.
10622.19|10627.36|I was getting 45 cents an hour, and I went through two different foremen with the same crew.
10627.4|10631.97|The first one died, and the second one was transferred.
10632.99|10636.21|The third one was a younger man, and he took a liking to them.
10636.25|10640.2|He'd come along one day, and he said, "You're only getting 45 cents an hour."
10640.22|10642.44|He said, "I'm going to put you up to 50 cents an hour."
10642.46|10644.45|That's the first-class lineman's wages.
10645.05|10647.41|He said, "You're doing as much work as any of the other fellows."
10647.47|10648.87|He said, "You ever work hotline?"
10648.91|10649.89|I said, "No."
10649.91|10653.92|Well, he said, I'll teach you a little bit about it.
10654.1|10661.42|So he started wearing rubber gloves now, and then he'd take me out to cut in transformers and this and that.
10662.78|10670.21|So you familiarize yourself with protecting yourself is the big thing when you're working around hot wires.
10671.85|10674.96|And then from there, when I went up
10676.03|10681.68|Kenmer, North Dakota, that was a year later.
10682.54|10686.69|There I got 78 cents an hour, but I had to pay my own room and board.
10686.75|10701.23|Then when I came up to Canada, which was the next year, there I got 80 cents an hour, 82 cents an hour, I think it was, and paid my own room and board.
10705.07|10708.96|And from there on, things went bad.
10709.0|10714.0|And it came back where a lineman was getting 50 cents an hour again instead of 82.
10714.08|10726.03|So I worked in the summer of 34, 35, part of 33 at 50 cents an hour and paid my own room and board.
10727.81|10730.46|But it didn't cost you much for room and board.
10730.5|10734.98|You could keep most places for a dollar, a dollar and a quarter a day.
10735.43|10739.5|Some places they'd even do your... go to a private home.
10739.52|10741.0|They'd even do your laundry for you.
10743.56|10745.28|So it was all very relative.
10746.94|10751.29|And when I started operating the power plant, I was getting $75 a month.
10754.15|10764.14|Then when they closed down that plant, which I related to earlier, and I went back to the Dominion Electric power,
10766.4|10773.37|There I was getting $135 a month, paid my own keep, but again, room and board for a dollar a day.
10773.45|10781.42|In fact, I was staying at Phyllis' folks' place, and that's where I got room and board and laundry for a dollar a day.
10784.21|10790.19|And as wages went up then, after I was married, that was about three years later,
10792.3|10794.02|I got a $10 raise.
10794.12|10796.81|That was my first raise in three years.
10798.25|10807.7|I got a $10 a month raise, and then of course you paid an extra $5 a month room and board.
10808.98|10811.79|Groceries were going up and what have you.
10814.03|10816.45|So it was all very relative.
10816.47|10819.28|Well, when I left there, then I started contracting.
10820.72|10821.82|I didn't take
10822.51|10824.99|any steady wage out of the company.
10825.67|10828.27|I just drew out money as I wanted to.
10828.29|10833.6|But you didn't need much to live on, maybe, oh, $200, $300 a month.
10840.34|10846.01|And when I incorporated then in 1953, I didn't know what wages I should draw.
10846.05|10850.67|So I asked the auditors, "What wages?"
10851.03|10852.37|should I take out of this?
10852.39|10855.97|Well, the rate your company is going, you should have $1,000 a month.
10857.61|10864.52|I'm coming to the end of this tape, so I'm just going to wind it up, and this will be the end of the history of LHA.
10865.18|10865.68|Thank you.
10867.97|10871.11|But I always had lots of money, never any shortage of money.
10871.93|10879.14|Then when I started contracting, this is after I'd been contracting, what,
10880.07|10899.48|five or six years when I when I incorporated and I never did change my wages then in the from 53 to 65 in 12 years I still took a thousand dollars a month but I was taking up big bonuses at the end of the year
