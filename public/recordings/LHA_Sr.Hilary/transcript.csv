6.44|25.76|This is June the 14th, 1988, and I just decided I'm going to put my obituary on tape, and it will save those left behind the trouble of figuring out all my brothers and sisters.
28.0|35.35|And they can use this as a guide, and it will probably be about what they'd want to put in the obituary.
37.22|67.18|so I'll start out with Achen Linden Hilary 86 years of age born in Mars, Iowa immigrated to his with his family to Canada in 1907 pre-deceased by his parents
68.22|96.1|one son brothers and three sisters leaves to mourn his loving wife Phyllis two sons Norman Norman and Daniel Norman
98.82|126.06|and Linda in brackets and Daniel three daughters Linda and John in brackets Berlin Feist and Blaze in brackets and Jane
127.47|140.37|Wa, Joe in brackets, and eight grandchildren.
140.39|144.47|Prayers in the evening of so-and-so.
152.54|156.47|Burial of...
156.68|160.65|A funeral mass at 7.30 on 13th and 15th evening.
165.09|175.99|Cremation and private burial.
176.01|182.48|Arrangements by Spears.
182.5|185.44|Or leave funeral home, whichever.
187.04|189.38|And I'll play this back and I'll see how it sounds.
191.77|205.31|I forgot to add, after naming the children, eight grandchildren.
208.51|214.5|Yes, I found I had room enough to put it in after Jane and Joel Wall were mentioned.
214.52|216.32|So that's taken care of.
217.57|218.09|the end.
220.89|235.25|Now I'm going to add a little more about my history, which possibly many of my family don't even know.
235.27|236.33|My business life.
240.66|245.14|After working at home on the farm until I was
248.04|264.79|24 years old, when I left the farm and started working in the electrical field in Iowa.
264.81|273.34|I worked for, in two years, I worked for the Iowa Electric.
274.89|304.83|northern light and power in south dakota the montana dakota power company in north dakota and then went to the dominion electric power company in estevan saskatchewan and the next electric company I worked for was the tompkins electric in saskatchewan where I operated the power plant and
305.21|317.79|took care of the business for two and a half years before it was sold out to the Dominion Electric Power.
319.88|333.31|And then I will add that while being a foreman from the time, from two years after the time I started, I was always in charge of
338.05|357.89|And my first venture into business was to become the president and general manager of Tompkins Electric, which was just a small electric plant, diesel plant.
357.91|363.34|And from there, I went back to work for the Dominion Electric Power.
365.96|369.45|and started contracting on my own in 1945.
376.3|391.92|And I might mention that I was the president of Tompkins Electric, the president of Achen Minerals, the founding president of RAL Minerals Limited,
395.36|422.62|the founding president of the Central Line Contractors Association, a charter member of the Kinsmen of Canada in the Estevan branch, a lifetime member of the BPOE Elks Lodge of Canada,
426.28|430.42|A life member of the Knights of Columbus, third degree.
434.2|441.97|And a 33-year member of the fourth degree Knights, Father Huguenard Assembly.
447.02|455.2|A member of the Regina Chamber of Commerce for 22 years.
460.46|477.51|I became a journeyman electrician in 1934 and still carry a journeyman certificate at the age of 86, though I never use it.
478.11|482.89|I still have the valid certificate.
482.92|486.76|I've been on the payroll of
487.63|497.8|Achen Construction 1965 Limited since the inception of the company 21 years ago.
502.65|514.84|They still pay me a standby pittance on account of my electrical journeyman's license, which sometimes is necessary
516.3|523.93|that they have a journeyman on certain types of work.
523.95|535.02|And that's just a quick resume of some of the things that I did in my lifetime.
535.04|541.45|I just got thinking about that the other day, and I thought, hey, I've been, not many guys have been president of so many companies.
543.07|546.31|They weren't very big ones, but they still needed looking after
550.38|576.92|I might add, and I forgot to add, that I was the founding president of Achen Construction Company in 1953 and remained as president until the company was sold in 1965 to Achen Construction, 1965 Limited, at which time I went into semi-retirement.
578.08|587.12|Which was purchased by four of my employees.
593.3|605.26|And it is still operating under my name, although since I made this tape, the company has been sold, sold all shares of the company.
606.8|611.27|and the name stayed with it.
611.37|621.14|The men that are running it now still use the name Aiton Construction.
621.16|623.6|1965 Limited.
624.76|634.75|I also, in replaying this now, noticed that I hadn't mentioned Survived by Sister Hilary.
635.98|646.13|And of course, she being two and a half years older than I, it's always assumed that she's going to die ahead of me.
648.1|649.5|But that's not for sure.
653.36|655.3|I just outlined all this.
655.32|660.91|I doubt if any of my children know.
662.31|667.94|of all the different things that I was involved in in my lifetime.
667.96|679.07|None of them very big, none of them very important, but they all served a purpose.
681.65|708.6|I see you smile There's a look so bashful in your eyes That convinces me not to rise Cut a lot beside me Hold my hand for a while For I could learn to love you
708.87|716.03|When yousmile.
716.19|724.8|How come along the edge of the water you don't have any water?
724.92|728.94|You've got the hose running.
729.0|730.35|It's not a sprinkling hose, is it?
730.42|731.83|Well, that's a sprinkler.
733.03|735.13|That sprays up when you turn it.
735.15|738.43|The pressure's going to shoot up in the air five, six feet, spread out.
739.29|739.99|Oh, okay.
740.01|742.42|And it wouldn't do that last night?
747.99|751.26|No, there wouldn't be enough pressure.
751.28|759.41|See, that's why I was saying you ought to just cut down the pressure and see if that's the soil.
759.43|759.69|Oh, I see.
759.71|760.46|The back operation.
761.16|765.17|I said, "I'm going to this world on my own."
766.15|771.6|So I went on New Central Street, St. Catherine Street.
771.68|774.5|And I ran about downtown.
774.52|779.69|Well, it wasn't very, St. Luke Hospital wasn't very, it's pretty well, it's a dead world of life in there.
779.71|783.66|And I, yeah, I saw a good piece of story.
783.99|787.68|I think, goodness, we used to get these catalogs, you know, of poetry.
788.26|791.65|The mail order house, something like that.
791.67|794.85|So it took in a whole huge block.
795.31|798.1|And as you said, you know, everybody spoke English.
798.76|801.55|I thought I had to speak French, but no, they all spoke English.
818.54|836.65|I wonder why a little bird like that catches water.
836.67|841.24|I have put water cans up on the fence.
841.25|841.78|I don't know what it does.
845.49|856.86|Maybe early in the morning.
871.67|872.79|My dad.
874.75|899.0|a little history to this tape on march the 31st we sold the property the building and the company shares to potash corporation of saskatchewan who will use it as a vehicle
900.82|930.13|to privatize the potash company this may surprise a lot of people why why they bought the company but they had to have a company that was legal for life and ours had to meet all the requirements I just thought somebody might be interested in this information
930.91|931.41|Thank you.
931.75|934.87|This is July the 1st, 1989.
937.78|938.68|Beautiful day.
940.86|944.59|I'm up by myself at 9 o'clock.
945.51|946.23|Pete and I.
947.79|951.25|And I've been going over the tapes I received from Andy Hammer.
951.76|954.22|And I happened to run across this one.
954.24|957.46|So I wanted to hear Sister Hilary sing that song again.
957.76|959.55|And I said...
960.88|964.27|I just run it over so I'll close off for now.
966.04|967.62|Over and under.
967.64|968.95|Over and out, they say.
