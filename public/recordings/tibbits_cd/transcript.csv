7.25|29.41|This is where Ben started taping the planes coming in, and then you and he went out and played, and I think there's some talking in there by Reverend Robert Shuler, but you'll just keep on playing until you get through to where your grandmother and I started talking.
29.43|29.97|Okay?
32.8|39.33|I just want to add a few words as to what the snowstorm was like here.
41.92|48.91|When you were on your way home Sunday, we were getting reports that the storm was coming into Calgary, and we wondered if you were going to run into it.
49.67|59.17|At any rate, we had about four to five inches of snow here.
60.01|61.83|It looked as though it would never go away.
61.89|63.37|There's that much wood laying around.
64.05|69.14|And then yesterday afternoon, it started thawing.
69.96|72.33|And now this afternoon, the lawns are all bare.
72.37|78.66|And the only snow that's around is on the north side of the buildings where the sun don't get at it.
78.68|80.66|So we're back into some reasonable weather.
80.68|82.42|It's about 10 above today.
84.33|87.65|I might add that Wally and Willa came up
89.56|92.34|Wednesday, Wednesday night, yes.
92.94|112.46|He was coming up for a doctor's appointment and Willa had an appointment also for some tests and they stayed Wednesday night and then Thursday they had their appointments and they went up and had supper at Joni's and then they came back here and
112.99|122.9|Naturally, each night we played rummy until about 1 o'clock, and there weren't any great winners or losers in the game, but we thoroughly enjoyed it.
123.46|136.7|And they left this morning about 11 o'clock, and they planned to go to Arizona about the first part of next week.
138.76|142.36|So that's the last we'll see of them for...
143.45|149.06|six months, unless something happens if they decide to come home.
152.45|160.06|And anyway, I don't know what else there is to tell you.
164.77|166.41|Accepting being a good girl
167.38|170.27|And don't remember, God loves you and so do I.
170.87|174.42|Don't forget, I mean, that God loves you and so do I.
175.65|176.65|So does your grandmother.
180.68|189.12|And then, run around the kitchen two times and say, hiya, Grams, every time you go around, okay?
189.7|191.02|Haha, bye!
192.96|199.39|Do the jumping jacks right at the door of the kitchen.
199.41|200.23|Thanks, bye.
202.7|204.89|testing.
206.01|214.91|Leslie, your grandmother and I are now going to try to answer the questions that you asked regarding the Depression in 1930.
216.21|218.56|From 1930 to 1939.
220.4|223.01|And you will
224.17|253.23|find some discrepancies in our taping because we're not experts at it like you and ben but from now on I'll have grandma read out your question and then we'll answer it that translates here comes question number one how did you make coffee in those days well some of the farmers roasted wheat or roasted barley and boiled it and use it for coffee and I can tell you it was
253.53|254.91|Plenty hard to take.
254.93|258.46|But I imagine you did have coffee if you wanted to buy it.
258.48|264.14|Oh yes, you could buy coffee and it was cheap, but then who had the money to buy it?
264.58|268.47|Did your family have a Bennett buggy?
268.49|272.13|No, we never had a Bennett buggy in our family somehow or other.
272.15|274.25|We escaped being that poor.
276.92|278.78|How much was milk and bread?
279.89|285.3|Well, you could buy bread in the stores at 10 cents a loaf and milk at about 5 cents a quart.
285.32|290.86|In fact, you could get cream, good, thick cream for 10 cents a quart.
290.88|292.36|And it wasn't pasteurized, was it?
292.66|297.03|No, no, it was straight from the cows, so to speak.
297.05|297.85|All right.
297.87|301.37|How much were wages in those days if you had a job?
303.03|309.66|Well, many young men had to work on the farms for $5 a month.
310.89|315.07|Most their wages were about 30 cents an hour.
315.15|316.94|That would be like $3 a day.
318.32|326.31|If you were working in a plant or in a coal mine, any labor of that type.
326.99|331.23|In the stores, if you were a clerk in the store, you probably got $50 a month.
334.44|337.96|Well, I had a business, and I used to take $8 a week out.
338.83|341.74|But I lived at home, so I didn't have to pay much board and room.
342.2|343.54|That would be $32 a month.
343.6|345.38|But that was enough to buy clothes on.
347.29|351.51|And I don't remember, we never had a Bennett buggy.
351.55|354.26|We had a car, but we couldn't afford to buy a license for it.
357.1|364.47|And I don't remember making a coffee or anything like that, but I know things were pretty tough.
365.33|368.35|But everybody else was poor, so it didn't seem to hurt too much.
368.37|370.17|Yeah, everybody was on the same level.
371.48|376.66|You'd be brought to a dance for 35 cents, and they'd throw in a lunch, and all that stuff.
376.68|380.09|And the church had a lot of card parties, and they'd serve a lunch after.
380.45|385.22|And bingo parties for a nickel a game, or whatever.
385.52|388.52|But anyway, we had a good time, even if we didn't have any money.
388.68|392.79|And I think maybe we had a better time than the teenagers do nowadays.
393.15|394.8|Yeah, you invented everything.
394.86|402.62|You invented your games, and if you had a jigsaw puzzle, when you were through with it, you didn't throw it away.
402.66|407.83|You'd give it to a neighbor, and they'd give it to another neighbor, and everybody concerned.
409.11|416.62|We used to do a lot of skating, and we lived around a country where it was hilly, so we did a lot of tobogganing and skiing.
417.48|421.88|We didn't have the warmest clothes in the world, but we always seemed to manage.
421.92|422.93|That's for sure.
423.72|429.2|The clothes we had in those days compared to today were really inadequate.
429.58|432.63|No such a thing as a parka or a hood.
432.69|437.01|And I can remember wearing, to high school, wearing long underwear.
437.07|442.2|Now I can just see the young girls wearing long underwear to high school now, as the saying is, long johns.
443.02|450.63|Yes, and you had to walk about a full mile to get there, and you went regardless of what the weather was.
452.47|458.52|Well, anyway, Les, this is about it, and I hope this did you some good for your school work.
460.72|469.06|During the Depression years, I spent a lot of time on the farm, and wages were not of consideration.
469.52|472.61|But one winter, I did work for my brother.
472.65|473.89|He was running the farm.
474.54|482.45|And I got $8 a month, and I worked from 6 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock at night, every day, seven days a week.
483.41|496.66|We had 60 head of cattle, 50 sheep, about 40 horses, and maybe 60 or 70 pigs, and 100 hens that were laying eggs.
496.76|502.19|And by the time we got up in the morning and made the rounds and
502.39|513.72|give them all their breakfast, and then you come in to the house, I can tell you, you're ready to eat your breakfast too, and you didn't question what it was, you ate whatever was prepared for you.
513.74|516.88|But all in all, we had a lot of fun there.
516.9|524.13|We used to get together with the neighbors and play cards, and we played poker, and we used matches for money.
524.59|531.26|No money ever exchanged hands, it was just, everybody was allotted 100 matches, and then from that,
531.58|535.75|You'd see who was the best card player at the end of the night.
535.77|539.07|You'd put the matches back in the box when you were finished.
539.09|548.36|And then we'd get together as families, total families, from 60 years down to six years old.
548.38|556.46|And you'd play games, all kinds of crazy games that everyone was involved in.
556.48|559.78|And you had more laughs than a little bit.
560.13|562.6|You went home feeling happy.
562.62|564.48|You never spent any money.
564.5|565.94|You didn't have any money to spend.
566.72|576.09|If you went to a dance, I said earlier, "A country dance would cost you maybe 35 cents admission."
576.11|581.56|And along with that, there was a lunch first, because everything was so cheap.
581.58|582.1|It makes sense.
582.12|583.2|It's for next to nothing.
584.47|586.17|Oh, it was a great life.
586.53|599.13|I was young at that time, and everybody else was young, and you accepted the fact you were all on the same level, and you lived life one day at a time.
599.15|611.82|So now we'll put this in, and I want to say, I just put this on the end of the tape that you and Ben have been playing with, and I don't know what's on the start of the tape or how far, but you'll start the tape.
613.07|617.39|You'll go right to the start of the tape, and then you'll go until you come to our story.
617.87|619.98|Right now, I'll turn the tape back to zero.
622.06|623.15|Goodbye for now.
627.01|634.48|Then the next election that you're going to hear is, you can record over the last one you heard or the one you hear this.
634.64|642.35|Just listen to it carefully, and there's some boring parts, but just be patient, and it's going to be something like five minutes long, okay?
644.31|652.62|And listen, there's going to be a pause at the end, and just listen to it for the little pause, and then listen to the next part.
652.64|653.02|Bye.
657.49|668.04|Recording over something so I just want to tell everyone that um I'm having fun in Regina and then
669.18|672.85|You know that note I wrote you at home saying I want to be your friend and everything?
672.89|677.49|Well, I'm going to say it here now, and I'm going to keep doing it until you do be my friend.
678.07|679.68|Okay, this is what I'm going to say.
681.0|685.44|Ben, I want you to be my friend, and I want you to be my pen pal.
686.3|689.91|And we keep writing it until you know what a pen pal is when you're in Toronto.
690.73|699.17|And I want you to write me, and I don't care how you do it, just write me, okay?
699.37|699.98|Thank you.
700.0|701.03|I love you, Ben.
703.08|704.68|I don't like that part.
708.82|713.85|Mrs. Jekyll, how do you think about this stuff about raising cat food?
715.15|715.59|I hate it!
715.89|722.16|That's why I just dumped my cat because there's no other food that I can give my cat.
723.02|726.11|Well, Mrs. Jekyll, how do you think about this?
728.55|729.19|I guess what?
730.5|732.46|I hate your castle and I hate this place.
733.3|735.28|And I think that...
746.77|747.88|Thank you, Mrs. Jekyll.
747.9|749.95|That was a very touching speech.
751.11|752.32|Want me to do it again?
753.02|753.12|Sure.
770.82|776.48|That was a very other touching speech.
776.5|777.51|It's different words, too.
780.29|781.95|Mrs. Jekyll?
781.97|782.51|Yes?
785.21|788.0|We're going to have to make a leave now.
788.02|788.18|Why?
789.3|790.74|Because you have to.
790.76|791.12|Why?
791.34|793.36|Because we have to interview the Couch Patch Kids.
794.08|794.68|Okay.
796.32|796.4|Bye.
799.11|801.97|Okay, Couch Project kids, come in.
802.91|804.34|Okay, we're sending them in.
806.48|808.32|We just closed the door for you.
809.56|811.0|Okay, what's your name, girly?
811.74|815.21|My name is Selena, and his name is Obie.
815.23|815.37|Yeah?
815.57|817.05|Who's that little friend you brought with you?
817.39|820.67|Oh, that's Bluey, with her little kids, Greeny and Pinky.
821.35|824.01|Okay, we'll interview Obie first.
824.03|825.07|Obie, how old are you?
826.34|827.72|Four months old.
828.63|829.49|Four months old?
829.75|830.57|Yeah.
831.39|832.63|Selena, how old are you?
834.06|835.34|I'm two years old.
836.42|836.94|No, you're not.
836.96|837.74|You're one year old.
838.18|838.86|That's right.
839.79|840.25|Blue?
842.11|843.37|Nine years old.
844.51|845.48|How old is Pinky?
846.4|847.66|Nine years old.
848.12|849.04|How old is Greeny?
851.15|851.75|Nine years old.
852.76|857.3|Oh, I hear, Bluey, did any of your kids do anything wrong?
858.22|858.69|Yes.
859.69|864.33|Greeny went away because he was looking for his father perfectly once.
865.03|867.96|And we found her and gave her a big smack.
867.98|874.39|And now she's grounded from her TV set down in my clothes for a long time.
874.73|877.95|But Pinky can watch it in the next room.
877.93|879.7|Oh, that's wonderful.
880.62|882.77|How long has Greeny been grounded?
883.47|884.19|Three years.
884.25|887.2|Two years, actually.
887.22|888.2|How long more?
889.06|889.6|Two years.
890.71|891.49|Okay.
892.46|895.69|Uh, Selina, has anything bad happened to you?
895.75|897.15|Yeah.
897.85|901.46|My mommy doesn't love me anymore because Obie came.
901.9|902.8|That isn't true.
902.92|903.46|I love you.
904.26|905.08|Well, okay.
905.42|906.22|I saw your mommy.
907.22|908.52|Obie, anything happen to you?
909.29|912.41|Yeah, it got real cold once and I sneezed.
913.01|913.99|Isn't that awful?
914.01|916.32|And I blew myself clear across the room.
916.34|918.58|Oh, that's bad.
918.6|920.3|And I still got the lump on my head.
920.32|921.86|Oh, let me see it.
923.02|924.71|Ooh, that sucker's big.
925.47|925.95|Yeah.
925.97|927.39|Oh no, it's coming down.
927.53|935.62|It's going and sucking into me.
935.64|937.93|Oh well, now you don't have it anymore.
937.95|939.31|You just have a sucked in head.
939.97|940.41|Oh well.
941.15|942.47|How many dimples do you have?
943.07|943.49|Two.
946.02|947.32|Two, boys and girls.
948.02|948.44|Two.
949.42|949.82|Two?
950.34|951.24|I thought I had three.
951.64|952.26|You have two.
952.28|952.94|You showed me.
954.1|955.79|How many do you have, Celine?
956.31|956.69|Two.
957.03|959.03|Wait, that's not... One.
959.19|960.2|And so does Obi.
960.22|960.62|Obi lied.
960.68|961.28|Obi lied.
961.3|961.4|Okay.
962.04|970.83|We're going to have to let you go and we're going to interview me.
973.94|979.1|I'm 10 years old and my mom's 36.
979.74|982.63|Ben's 13 turning 14.
982.99|986.58|I'm 10 turning 11.
987.09|990.45|Blaze is 38 turning 39.
990.71|993.29|My mom's 36.
993.37|996.18|My Auntie Jane just had a new baby.
996.2|997.36|She already has two.
998.9|999.66|And it's a boy.
1000.48|1006.95|And I'm going down to PEI when I go to my dad's in 12 days.
1006.99|1010.71|And we're going to have a whole bunch of fun.
1011.72|1015.39|We're going to go to PEI, and we're going to have a whole bunch of fun there.
1015.43|1022.15|And we just hope that my dad's back to some breakout again.
1026.86|1028.14|What's your name anyway?
1029.3|1030.72|Oh, my name is Leslie.
1031.75|1034.19|Oh, that's nice.
1034.21|1035.11|So, Leslie.
1038.62|1042.66|I guess we're gonna have to go unless we have someone else come in here to interview.
1043.6|1045.19|Me.
1045.21|1045.75|Who are you?
1046.81|1049.59|Oh, it only hurts.
1049.61|1051.52|But I have very noisy feet.
1051.54|1053.54|Listen to me walk across the room.
1059.85|1061.35|Oh, that's quite noisy.
1062.85|1065.19|Well, we're going to have to go now.
1065.21|1071.06|I'm three years old, and I have 26 babies, and I have 18 husbands.
1072.06|1073.04|Oh, that's nice.
1074.2|1075.08|How many do you have now?
1075.1|1078.97|48 husbands and 64 kids.
1080.23|1081.55|Oh, can you bring your kids here?
1082.21|1083.99|Wait, they have noisy feet too.
1084.01|1085.11|You sure you want?
1085.13|1086.4|Sure, I want them.
1087.26|1087.9|Just bring them.
1104.92|1115.5|That's only 36 of them.
1115.62|1117.76|Shut up, children.
1119.02|1122.23|Shut up.
1122.25|1123.61|Okay, they're all here.
1123.71|1125.07|So, what's your name?

1126.62|1128.02|Just say them when I point to you.
1128.66|1128.92|Beep.
1129.96|1135.73|Oh, how many are you?
1135.75|1140.7|How old are you?
1140.72|1151.33|8, 6, 4, 6, 5, 8, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1,
1152.0|1154.67|One of you is 84.
1156.75|1157.67|Oh, that's the dad.
1157.69|1159.63|I'm sorry.
1159.65|1163.45|Okay, so I guess we're going to have to go now.
1165.58|1179.41|So, peace be with you and join us next week for our next thing when we interview Shadastonio cats and Beagle mouse.
1180.93|1181.87|So, bye.
1186.28|1187.6|Hello.
1188.38|1190.69|We are going to the ground again.
1191.41|1194.49|So then, I hope you listen to that very carefully.

1464.13|1465.56|Leslie's singing now.
1465.58|1466.58|This is so stupid.
1466.6|1467.2|Listen to this.
1467.76|1469.14|You better hear this.
1469.16|1475.53|It's so funny.
1475.55|1476.79|So funny.
1477.73|1480.19|So funny.
1480.21|1485.76|I don't know if she's singing anymore or what.
1485.78|1489.02|I was going to the washroom and I walked in.
1489.04|1489.8|In what?
1489.82|1492.07|I walked in and I didn't know he was there.
1493.63|1494.13|So?
1497.18|1499.24|You can tell by what she just said, eh?
1499.64|1504.41|She walked in going... What?
1504.43|1512.42|She just tried to pull up her pants like a little perv here, eh?
1523.17|1530.0|That was her perfect singing there, just the... Now she's stomping out of the room like a little cry baby.
1531.1|1540.99|We're gonna walk over there and look at her some more.
1541.01|1542.44|I'm sneaking into the kitchen.
1543.58|1548.06|No sign of Leslie.
1552.33|1561.98|I'm in the living room, walking around.
1562.0|1562.76|Can you hear me?
1581.98|1583.81|Ah, I see her in the closet.
1583.87|1587.25|What do you have to say about me finding you in this closet in the back hall by the dryer?
1587.27|1587.79|Here's the dryer.
1589.09|1590.9|Okay, now what do you have to say about me finding you, Leslie?
1592.02|1595.38|Talk.
1595.4|1597.08|Unless I can beat the reporter.
1599.63|1605.31|Ah, so Leslie says... Hey, I have an idea.
1605.33|1607.8|I have an idea.
1607.84|1609.8|I'll just turn off the tape recorder and ask Leslie.
1611.01|1623.18|I just had breakfast.
1623.26|1638.52|I'm going to have a peanut butter sandwich.
1639.01|1640.51|I don't know.
1640.79|1644.97|Five seconds.
1645.29|1654.33|You said bad things about me, so I can say bad things about you.
1654.35|1660.03|Well, you have to because I'm recording.
1660.05|1663.84|I don't have to say anything.
1663.86|1665.34|You just did.
1665.36|1666.26|You just said anything.
1667.16|1668.4|I don't have to say anything.
1671.21|1675.64|Which microphone sounds better?
1675.66|1676.72|This one here.
1678.58|1681.63|Or this one here.
1684.14|1685.62|Okay, I'll plug in the other one again.
1686.64|1689.05|Let's see what happens.
1689.97|1697.55|No, I'm not going to let you look anymore at Wes, am I?
1697.57|1700.3|But nothing new yet.
1701.7|1704.49|Yeah.
1711.2|1719.19|Let us in inside.
1719.21|1721.71|Ben's a fink.
1725.55|1728.42|Don't touch that microphone.
1728.52|1730.4|It doesn't matter what the mic turned on and off.
1730.42|1732.24|See, your plan didn't work.
1732.26|1732.44|I didn't.
1735.52|1748.54|Playing with their alphagitties.
1748.7|1756.94|Thank you.
1757.42|1780.42|The Russians have been drilling in the U.S. for many years.
1781.38|1785.63|They started a continental exploration program, a geological exploration program, in the early 70s.
1785.65|1787.01|And they began calling for a peninsula, which is up near Finland.
1787.63|1796.0|You know what that stuff is inside those glasses?
1796.02|1796.74|What?
1796.76|1798.04|It's that alpha gel.
1798.32|1801.53|Yeah, it is.
1801.55|1805.79|It kind of sticks to it.
1805.81|1811.8|Is it out of it now?
1814.64|1816.39|Careful.
1816.79|1817.77|Okay.
1817.89|1821.0|We should get him a special glass for it.
1821.78|1822.34|Four.
1822.72|1823.8|X.
1827.23|1828.39|Two.
1828.69|1828.77|One.
1831.92|1847.8|Oh, it looks like one of those coffee tables from those classical tables.
1847.82|1850.07|There you go.
1850.11|1851.43|The bottom underneath the holes.
1851.45|1852.23|What was it in?
1852.25|1853.11|Your food?
1853.13|1855.09|I laid it on the floor.
1855.11|1856.42|I found it on the floor.
1856.44|1859.98|I know, but is that what it's from?
1860.48|1860.58|Yeah.
1860.56|1862.56|What is that stuff?
1863.47|1869.77|Don't put it in the toilet!
1869.9|1874.04|Do you like this?
1874.1|1875.16|Tomato?
1877.07|1878.25|He's innocent this time.
1878.39|1882.21|No pasty glass in the toilet.
1885.62|1895.22|Yeah, and he would have done that too.
1896.2|1903.95|He might have taken, he used to fall on the floor and try to throw it in the garbage and missed it.
1903.97|1907.25|And he could have just done it there.
1907.51|1909.52|He told the grandchildren not to do that.
1909.54|1912.52|Pardon Robert or Peter, they weren't even born yet.
1913.13|1918.68|Keep your place and your picture on there, right?
1919.6|1920.82|Another picture over there?
1920.84|1923.02|Keep your place and get over there?
1923.04|1923.26|What?
1923.4|1927.95|You don't get one to replace the picture.
1927.97|1929.66|You don't?
1929.68|1930.58|Start sending it over.
1931.0|1932.36|Oh, my school picture.
1932.38|1936.03|Well, here's the stuff to hire a picture of.
1936.05|1936.47|Wait, seven or eight?
1937.14|1944.53|What the water?
1944.55|1945.9|That's great.
1946.35|1949.26|I had a surprise.
1949.38|1953.02|What's on my face there?
1953.04|1955.75|Because I wanted to... What?
1955.85|1957.29|You know, shh.
1957.55|1958.51|Ride the load.
1958.53|1958.75|What?
1958.77|1961.63|I don't know.
1962.14|1966.58|I think you said some kind of stupid thing.
1966.6|1967.68|Like a joke?
1968.0|1971.23|Like, fuzzy beagles.
1971.25|1972.85|Is that what he said to you?
1973.89|1981.48|No, that's what that one photographer said.
1981.5|1988.13|And we went to get that family picture taken.
1988.29|1992.23|And at school, I learned a technique.
1992.25|1999.36|Of course, she said she had no idea where it was going to come out.
2003.47|2007.29|Were your friends sorry to see you go?
2007.31|2011.18|Well, my friends were, but not the rest of the people in my class.
2011.2|2015.3|Everybody was clapping when they found out I was cleaning.
2015.83|2019.15|In my class, everybody was clapping except for Gladys.
2019.29|2021.71|I'm going to go out and clean.
2022.05|2023.65|What did you do?
2023.67|2024.23|Huh?
2024.65|2026.19|What did you do?
2026.49|2032.96|After school, I said, "What's the hard idea about?"
2033.04|2037.99|No, I, um, told them I didn't care.
2038.21|2040.15|I didn't like them either.
2040.17|2041.45|Why didn't you tell anyone?
2042.23|2043.42|I didn't.
2043.5|2046.84|In the student of the month, the second last day of school,
2046.82|2054.55|Mr. Spavor made all the people who were going to the new school stand up.
2055.17|2065.03|And we all stood up, and Mr. Spavor had some of those student of the month's classes left, so we and Sandy thought, oh goody, we're going to get some classes.
2065.17|2069.12|And then they found out they're for the teachers, something like that.
2069.84|2078.88|the second planet in the summer skies, well to the right of Jupiter over in the southwest.
2078.9|2083.87|In fact... Is that a cat that's doing what you're going through?
2084.11|2085.87|Radio.
2091.06|2098.41|It almost makes you wonder what it's all about when you've got a thing like this and you try and use it.
2098.43|2107.56|And when you come back to turn it on, play it for an hour, and you get nothing out of it.
2107.58|2109.57|You never break things by using them.
2109.59|2113.21|You break them by playing with them.
2113.23|2116.12|That's been my experience at any rate.
2121.13|2135.7|Great show, isn't it?
2139.21|2146.23|Now you wonder what the kids are doing.
2147.35|2154.2|Let's go.
2155.02|2158.63|Rec was a trip.
2158.65|2166.82|Used to be in with some San Francisco band, but now mostly you feel that thing.
2169.38|2171.9|Sucker!
2175.89|2179.62|Ben's dealing.
2180.66|2193.06|Do you have any comment, Ben?
