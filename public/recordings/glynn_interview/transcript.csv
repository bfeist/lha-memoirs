7.19|8.11|Where you were born?
8.57|21.06|Oh, I was born in a little town of Remsen, Iowa, about 20 miles out of Sioux City, Iowa, in what was known as the Corn Belt of Iowa.
21.08|21.48|In what year?
22.29|22.61|In 1902.
22.63|22.85|1902.
23.31|26.27|So in the Depression, you'd be how old?
26.75|27.17|19, 20?
27.23|32.4|Well, as far as the Depression, the roof sort of fell.
33.82|35.3|The roof fell in about...
36.21|40.28|In 1929, I was 27 years old at that time.
40.3|41.78|And where were you then?
41.8|43.66|I was at Halbrite.
43.68|44.56|Saskatchewan.
44.68|48.23|In the, you can say, Weyburn-Estevan area.
49.05|49.99|And we had a farm.
50.35|52.07|I was brought up on a farm at Halbrite.
52.53|54.22|Your whole family was there then?
54.24|54.42|Oh, yeah.
54.44|56.48|We were a big family when we came up from Iowa.
56.76|64.03|We were, what, father and mother and 12 children, and one was born after we came.
64.61|65.81|Why did they move from Iowa?
66.22|67.78|Why did they move up?
68.5|70.04|That's a good question.
71.24|78.33|I've asked that many times during the dry years when the country blew out and everything was against you.
78.35|80.23|Why did Dad ever leave Iowa?
80.25|81.8|But he homesteaded, didn't he?
81.82|82.44|No, he didn't.
82.64|85.74|We bought land and he paid a big price for it.
86.64|90.25|Prairie, you might say, and broke it up with horses.
91.27|93.34|and did everything the hard way.
93.36|96.24|But he had a lot of manpower, this growing family.
96.5|102.18|The oldest one was 20 years old when we moved up here.
103.28|104.02|You were in the middle.
104.04|105.14|We were nine boys.
105.4|108.15|No, I was the seventh son.
108.17|111.06|And then there were girls after you.
111.49|114.07|Three girls before me and one right after me.
114.88|116.34|So you were near the end, then.
116.46|117.84|So we were a big family.
117.86|120.56|So a lot of those boys stayed on the farm?
120.58|121.0|Oh, yes.
121.06|127.39|In those days, you stayed home and worked for your keep until you were 21 years old.
127.67|128.83|And then you flew the coop.
128.85|130.0|Not like they do nowadays.
130.01|131.96|They want to go at 16 or 17.
132.88|136.68|We stayed home and you worked without wages until you were 21 years old.
136.82|137.89|And that was the standard.
138.57|167.23|okay so now you were 28 or 29 in the beginning of the depression when the depression started yeah and you had that home i left home when i was 24 years old my father died when i was 21 years old and i was the oldest one home and i took over the management of the farm so what were you doing then when the depression started where were you i was uh uh i was back in the area
169.35|175.18|I went into the power business, or working at power, in 1927.
175.22|182.55|And I started in Iowa, as queer as it may seem.
182.57|188.92|I started in Iowa, went to Nebraska, then South Dakota, then North Dakota, and finally I wound up at Esseland in 1929.
189.78|191.82|You were working for yourself?
191.86|193.06|With the power.
193.1|193.62|For yourself?
193.64|194.76|No, no, I wasn't a contractor.
194.78|196.27|I was working for a power company.
196.43|197.27|Oh, a power company.
197.29|197.39|Yeah.
197.96|202.46|and started without any education or anything, just started from the bottom.
202.71|205.41|This is a private power company?
205.43|210.72|Yes, at that time we had private power companies in Saskatchewan.
211.5|217.02|The power commission didn't start until 1928 when it was formed.
217.04|218.39|So what did you do?
218.79|219.49|What did I do?
219.87|223.13|A small power company, not really small either.
223.15|227.14|We had about 70 employees throughout the province.
227.71|234.57|And when I started in power, I started digging holes right from the bottom, on the end of the shovel, so to speak.
234.59|236.2|So in 1930, what were you doing?
236.22|237.0|I was a lineman.
237.02|241.8|By that time, I had graduated up, and I was what they called a hot lineman.
241.84|242.96|I could work anything.
243.88|246.33|And how much money did you make?
246.35|252.45|In 1930, when I started Estevan, I was making 82 cents an hour and paying my own keep.
253.01|254.29|Was that good wages?
254.31|256.42|That was good, yes, extremely good.
256.62|259.8|Now, did your wages stay the same all the way through the Depression?
259.82|261.8|Well, no.
263.74|265.23|I have to stop and think now.
265.61|269.73|In 29, it was just by chance that I got on with this power company.
270.79|273.89|In the meantime, I had gone back on the farm.
274.69|278.1|My brother and I started farming, and then mother wanted to come back on the farm.
278.12|283.49|So I ran into this power job, and I went back to it.
283.5|285.09|But only worked in the fall.
286.31|287.6|On the power corporation?
287.62|287.72|Yeah.
288.14|292.2|And then in the next spring, Mother wanted to come back on the farm, and I went back to the power company.
292.46|294.99|Wages were 55 cents an hour.
295.81|296.53|They had dropped in?
297.11|298.89|Yeah, that's when the roof really fell in.
298.93|303.94|I'd got 82 the fall before, and 55 when I come back this spring.
303.98|309.11|And I, independent of me, no way am I going to work for 55 cents an hour.
309.15|311.79|And I packed up and went back to the farm.
313.39|314.1|And did you stay there?
314.46|319.63|Well, I stopped in town on the way home, and I bought a rifle, which I still have today.
319.67|321.91|And I went out shooting golfers.
322.01|325.0|And on the farm, you could always earn your keep, you know.
325.52|328.12|We always had livestock, so you always helped.
329.28|331.79|And we had a good home on the farm.
331.81|334.47|You said your mom had moved off the farm then, in the meantime, had she?
334.49|335.37|Just for a year.
335.43|338.0|She was going to retire and go into labor, and she couldn't take it.
338.1|340.16|And who was on the farm in the meantime?
340.68|341.04|Your brother?
341.06|343.6|My brother, just younger than myself, took over the farm, yes.
344.1|344.18|Hmm.
344.43|351.73|So, you were saying that you had how many in your family?
352.01|352.53|Thirteen.
354.27|354.59|Thirteen.
355.79|356.63|Oh, my goodness.
356.65|357.44|She had fifteen.
358.42|361.26|Yeah, that's what my mother said.
361.88|366.81|The first time she had gone to a doctor after Dad died, she took sort of a nervous breakdown and
367.43|368.39|She came into my room.
368.45|369.92|I was thinking about that this morning.
369.94|374.93|It's funny that I woke up and here was Mother standing by the bed and said, I think I'm going to die.
376.31|380.5|This was about two months after Dad had died.
380.52|382.12|And so I didn't know what to do.
383.74|386.83|Just my two brothers and myself were there.
387.07|387.93|They were both younger.
388.99|392.6|So I phoned up the neighbor lady, who was a widow woman, and I said, "
392.71|415.11|mother was sick and whatever she would come with me and go to the doctor in wayburn so we took her to wayburn and doctor sent her away on a holiday that's all she need to get away after raising 15 or 13 kids oh and i have i'm coming back to that now the doctor said, "Looking her over and you had 13 children"
415.93|419.12|And mother said, I was afraid to tell him I'd had 15.
421.66|422.36|Do him more.
422.38|425.82|We're going to make any difference.
425.84|429.17|OK. How much schooling did you get?
429.2|431.75|Part.
432.09|434.25|What grade did you go to in school?
434.27|434.37|Oh.
435.55|442.54|Well, I went through grade six and about six weeks of grade seven.
442.56|443.78|And then why did you stop?
445.09|450.86|Well, the teacher we had at the time, this was country school, and I couldn't see eye to eye.
450.96|454.32|I was at the ornery age, I guess, eh?
455.43|456.33|Well, like Jeffrey.
456.35|456.73|Yeah.
457.19|469.77|Well, no, oh no, I was older than that, because I look back now and I say I was in grade five when I was at the convent, and I had turned 11 that fall.
470.56|475.38|And I don't know where the years went, because it seemed to me I was about 15 when I quit.
476.59|478.87|No, I think maybe kids didn't go as far.
478.89|480.29|Mine may have taken five twice.
480.31|483.06|I don't remember that.
483.07|490.14|Okay, so now you were in, you were saying, working for the Power Corporation in 1930, and you had a room and board, did you?
490.83|491.99|You rented a room?
492.89|497.8|At that time, you could go to a private home almost anywhere and get room and board there.
498.37|499.65|Paid my own room and door.
499.95|500.05|Yeah?
500.45|503.05|What would you have to pay for a room and door?
503.07|507.36|Oh, so reasonable you wouldn't believe it, about maybe a dollar a day or $35 a month.
507.4|510.25|And that included your board and the whole business?
510.26|512.43|Yeah, and even throwing the laundry some places.
514.01|514.51|I wouldn't agree.
514.55|515.61|How did they make any money?
516.67|522.84|Well, you'll find in that folder you have there where they're selling six loaves of bread for 54 cents.
522.86|524.61|Oh, that's true.
524.63|526.13|That tells you part of the story.
526.46|531.99|Okay, now even on your own farm then, did they own the farm by that time?
532.03|534.88|They didn't have a mortgage on it?
534.9|536.28|You know, people ask me that today.
536.3|542.53|In fact, the man that's living on the farm today has 13 children, which is sort of a coincidence.
542.57|547.67|He was at our home here about five years ago talking about the farm.
548.25|549.86|He said, "How did your dad do it?"
550.46|554.66|You know, he's into it right up to here, keeps buying more land and getting people.
555.74|556.78|I said, "I don't know."
557.12|560.65|I knew nothing about the financing, how Dad arranged that.
560.67|571.52|But I said, Dad went in there and paid a big price for that prairie, put buildings on it, put fences around it, put a well on it that never went dry.
571.56|574.19|It cost thousands of dollars to get a well.
575.63|578.85|And I said, he died 17 years later, and it was all paid for.
578.87|580.1|He didn't know.
580.52|581.88|How big a farm was it?
581.9|582.68|Just a section.
583.54|584.6|One section of the land.
584.63|589.18|So nobody was bothered then about losing the farm or mortgaging or anything?
589.2|590.02|Oh, yes, yeah.
590.04|595.94|We were one of the lucky ones because, again, that great pool of manpower there.
597.35|600.95|You know, you had lots of manpower to do everything.
600.97|603.05|Right, because everybody had their own job.
603.07|610.44|And all it cost us, we grew our own garden, our own meat and vegetables and everything.
611.3|614.28|And I remember, this was during the Depression,
615.04|625.85|when I wasn't working, and we'll come to that later, when Mother would keep the four of us for $10 a month, and we ate like every meal was a feast.
626.97|631.24|Okay, now you said, okay, you were in 1930 and you were working for the Power Corporation.
631.26|631.42|Yeah.
631.44|637.74|Stopped, went back to the farm for a little while, and then went back and found out the wages were 55 cents.
637.76|640.52|Then I, no, then I went back to the,
641.72|644.26|I went on strike, a one-man strike.
644.28|645.61|I didn't have a union behind me.
645.68|648.65|I went on strike, and I went out to the farm.
651.11|652.83|And the company come back after me.
652.87|657.42|I met the general manager on the train one day, and he said, "I thought you were working."
657.44|657.84|I said, "No."
658.22|664.29|I said, "They only offered me $0.45 or $0.55 an hour, and I'm not going to work for $0.55 an hour."
664.31|666.17|I was worth $0.82 an hour.
666.19|667.13|It was independent of me.
667.51|670.82|I was worth $0.82 an hour last fall, and I'm worth that much now.
671.4|676.21|When they got back town a week later, I got a phone call, come to work.
676.23|677.19|So I went to work.
678.11|681.03|And my first check came through at 75 cents an hour.
681.85|684.64|And I went to the foreman on the crew.
684.66|688.76|I said, "Look, how come I'm only getting 75 cents an hour?"
690.3|695.07|He said, "When I saw your work, he says, I told them to give you the same wages you had last year."
695.53|698.49|But he said, somebody else cut it back to 75 cents.
698.51|701.17|Well, I said, "Right now I'm doing 75 cents
701.39|703.61|worth of work an hour and no more, that's all.
706.14|709.16|And I was looking for the superintendent when he comes through.
711.22|714.04|And he hit town on a Saturday night, and he was looking for me.
714.07|716.99|And when I found him, I was going to really have it out with him.
717.01|720.81|The first thing he said to me, look, he said, "Do you think you can run the crew?"
720.89|722.15|I said, "Do you think I can?"
722.2|723.34|He said, yes, I do.
723.36|728.0|Well, he said, "Bill Wilson broke his leg, and I want you to take the crew Monday morning."
728.56|730.71|He said, your wages would be $0.85 an hour.
732.83|734.23|So you didn't have to fight with them?
734.25|735.35|That was the end of the fight.
735.89|738.83|And I worked that whole summer running the crew.
740.22|744.3|And that winter they put me taking over service work in Estevan.
746.04|749.24|And then I saw the Power Commission advertising for people.
749.56|752.45|So I went to my boss and I said, "Look, I said, what about that?"
752.47|756.53|They want servicemen.
756.55|759.01|Well, he said, "I'll tell you, they'll be around here when we're gone."
759.27|760.57|Now, I knew nothing about
761.26|763.97|the government going to take over all the power companies.
764.11|765.33|But he knew that was coming.
766.95|770.51|So he said, "Why don't you put in your application?"
772.03|773.57|If you get a job, OK.
773.59|776.2|If you don't, we'll keep you here.
776.54|778.18|So I put in my application.
778.2|783.86|I had a phone call in a couple of days to come up to Regina.
783.88|785.71|And then I started working for the government.
786.12|786.95|You worked here in Regina?
788.25|789.45|They had head office here.
790.13|791.05|And you worked out of here?
791.16|793.01|No, they sent me to Saskatoon.
794.63|795.47|How long did they stay there?
796.35|804.02|Well, I'm going to say to you like I said to my fourth cousin, Lisa.
804.08|815.08|She was only 16 years old, and she started quizzing me one night, like you're quizzing me now, except that she is quizzing me about my private life, why I didn't get married until I was 38 years old and all that.
816.12|819.15|And I said, "Look, you know more about me than most people know."
819.23|822.59|I said, "You've asked me these kind of questions, and you're getting around to that now."
823.15|824.77|However, it's still a secret.
828.5|830.04|How long did I stay in Saskatoon?
830.06|836.73|Yes, when I was hired in Saskatoon, they had another fellow that was a practical man, but had university education.
836.85|841.53|I was a practical man with a grade seven education, or six and a half, whatever you want to call it.
842.87|844.49|So I got the class B district.
844.95|846.19|which was Saskatoon.
846.21|847.91|Class A district was Rosetown.
848.69|853.03|When I went into Saskatoon, I was working directly under the superintendent.
853.05|854.97|And this would be what year with Dixie?
854.99|856.17|That was in '31.
856.2|858.52|I went up there in January of '31.
858.64|868.14|And after I was there, I had an easy job, an awful easy job.
868.5|873.99|They didn't want me to be traveling because they paid me 10 cents a mile for my car, and that cost money.
874.34|879.79|They felt the pinch too easy.
880.03|886.33|So I had three areas to look after going out of Saskatoon, north and east and south and east.
887.21|890.01|And 11 towns I had to look after.
890.04|891.82|So I could handle that.
891.84|892.56|There was no problem.
892.98|894.08|You said you had a car.
894.32|898.72|Did you buy it when you started working?
898.74|899.72|Yes, I had a car.
899.88|903.39|Now, to come back to that, I had a windfall.
904.09|906.7|My mother was making money on the farm.
906.74|913.59|That was the years that I was in the States, and she had $2,000 accumulated, and she gave each of us kids $500.
913.69|915.81|And you bought a car with yours?
916.11|918.02|So I bought a car, not a new car.
918.1|920.34|I bought a second-hand car for, I think, $650.
920.36|923.37|It was in good shape, almost like new.
923.58|928.17|So, in other words, you didn't find that the Depression really changed things that much?
928.19|929.37|It wasn't affecting me, no.
929.57|935.74|Really, I didn't... Well, you're always short on money, but you didn't spend a dollar unless you had to.
936.33|938.85|But you had a job then all the way through the Depression?
938.87|939.17|No.
939.35|941.53|Then I come to that now.
941.71|942.67|I left Saskatoon.
942.8|948.02|In four months in Saskatoon, the superintendent asked me if I wanted to go out to Rosetown.
948.04|949.07|And I said, "Why Rosetown?"
949.09|949.61|Well, he said,
949.91|954.0|"Jimmy Jackson's got things so messed up out there, he says, we've got to let him go."
955.18|957.1|So I was transferred to Rosetown.
957.12|959.85|I said, "I want the Class A wages, too."
959.87|968.08|I was getting $155 a month at the power, and the Class A was $165 a month.
968.1|974.41|So I went to Rosetown and took over there, and did join the work.
974.43|975.61|I was young and ambitious.
976.22|981.36|The power lines had been built in the wintertime, and the poles were leaning all over the place.
982.62|985.95|And so I'd go out and straighten all this up on my own.
985.97|990.81|I used to hire a young fellow in every town, pay him 30 cents an hour.
991.03|995.2|And the two was, we were a two-man crew.
995.24|1002.33|I sent a bill in for the wages, and oh, the guy in Regina, he just raised a dick, and what authority did I have to hire a man?
1004.43|1012.26|So when he came out one day through the district and he saw what I was doing, he didn't say, boy, that looks really good.
1012.28|1016.11|He just made all his other district men do what I had been doing.
1018.57|1020.12|So that burned me up.
1020.27|1029.63|At another time, I found some trouble on a bridge at a river which was just outside of my territory, and I reported that, and I got a nasty letter telling me to stay in my own territory.
1030.19|1031.55|Then they sent somebody else.
1031.8|1034.69|to fix the trouble that I had filed.
1034.71|1036.47|But you were to mind your own business.
1037.17|1039.11|Well, I was independent as hell.
1040.52|1050.49|So I told the superintendent in Saskatoon, I said, "You tell that guy in Regina that he better pull in his horns or I'll tell him to stick his job."
1050.55|1051.69|That's what I'll tell him.
1051.71|1052.63|What's in Regina?
1052.65|1054.58|Pardon?
1054.6|1055.04|Chickling.
1058.0|1059.68|Oh.
1060.15|1062.31|Saving money, you know, I had money in the bank.
1062.33|1063.71|Oh, I bought a brand new car.
1063.73|1066.16|Then I traded my old one and then bought a brand new car.
1066.58|1068.86|It sounds like you were having a good time in the Depression.
1068.88|1069.92|Oh, you should have been there.
1069.96|1072.48|You should have been there.
1073.57|1078.13|And so about the end of September, I heard from my mother.
1079.49|1082.77|She said, "She'd like to take a trip back to Iowa."
1082.97|1084.26|I said, "Oh, nothing to it."
1084.28|1085.14|I phoned in during.
1085.16|1087.24|I said, "I want leave of absence."
1087.26|1090.04|I said, "I'm going to take my mother down on a trip to Iowa."
1091.32|1093.64|And, well, he said, I won't guarantee you a job.
1093.66|1096.74|Oh, I said, I'm not worried about a job, you know.
1096.77|1100.11|Independent as they come, I'm not worried about a job.
1101.45|1104.33|So I took my mother to Iowa.
1104.51|1106.11|We were gone about six weeks.
1107.73|1109.23|I had a rip-snorting time.
1109.3|1112.04|I had been down there before and knew all my cousins.
1112.06|1112.86|And all the contacts.
1113.42|1114.9|Oh, yeah, we had a lot of fun.
1116.6|1120.9|And then when I come back, I get in the town of Midale, where my
1122.45|1129.0|My brother married a girl from Midale, and there they wanted to put a little power system in Midale.
1129.02|1131.59|So instead of going back to the... A private one?
1131.61|1133.57|Yes, the village itself.
1134.59|1142.68|So instead of going back to the Power Commission and looking for a job, I took on the contract of putting this thing in for them, which I did.
1142.7|1148.97|And then I stayed in all winter in wired homes and kept busy that way.
1148.99|1151.77|And the next spring, now we're into '32,
1152.24|1154.26|I come back up to China.
1154.28|1156.53|Oh, hiring.
1156.55|1158.89|Power Commission said, we're still laying off men.
1158.95|1159.79|We're not hiring.
1160.31|1160.91|No way.
1161.83|1165.96|So I went back home on the farm and just coasted.
1165.98|1167.16|Had money in the bank.
1168.36|1169.92|Independent, you know.
1169.94|1171.02|Good home to stay in.
1171.12|1174.23|And I could always work enough to earn my keep.
1174.25|1176.93|And make a few dollars on the side here and there.
1177.79|1178.31|Until when?
1180.04|1181.86|All of '32...
1183.36|1190.43|And into '33, then the power company in Estevan phoned me up one day and asked me to come down for about a month.
1190.51|1193.49|They need a man for about a month.
1193.51|1198.6|So I went down and I worked in Estevan for about a month.
1200.24|1209.11|And then they had another project starting up there, building another town out by Gull Lake.
1210.04|1215.02|The boss said, I'm going to send you out there to put in that distribution system.
1215.04|1218.79|So essentially after that you had a job, all the rest of the depression.
1218.81|1220.87|Yeah, then I went out there and I had a job.
1220.93|1222.15|Well, we're still in depression.
1222.21|1224.66|Things are really tough, you know, but not for me.
1224.82|1226.58|I'm always...
1226.74|1229.38|But were you the only person you knew like that?
1229.4|1233.53|I mean, a lot of people say that there was a depression, but I can't... Well...
1233.98|1235.94|It was more for married people then, right?
1235.96|1237.03|I'll put it this way, I guess.
1237.2|1241.59|I had the ability to do the work for about one and a half men all the time.
1242.71|1244.15|And that's the way I worked.
1244.63|1250.06|So that if there was work around, I was the guy that could...
1250.08|1253.6|They didn't give any preferential treatment then to people who were married?
1254.2|1254.5|Pardon?
1254.6|1255.62|They didn't give any...
1255.64|1258.15|They didn't give the married men more of a chance?
1258.17|1261.81|Well, I could have bumped a married man in Estevan, but...
1261.96|1263.06|I said, "No way."
1263.08|1266.08|I said, "He's got two kids to keep, and I can look after myself."
1266.54|1271.31|And you didn't have to contribute to the farm or to your mother to stop keeping or anything like that?
1271.33|1271.53|Oh, no.
1271.55|1272.33|No, I struck down, no.
1272.35|1276.67|But when I worked then, I worked the summer of 30.
1276.93|1277.93|That was the fall of '33.
1277.95|1291.55|Yeah, then in '34, then the same company said they'd put me into Gull Lake rewiring buildings, business places that were
1291.9|1296.84|hay wired in, you know, went and straightened up all the metering and everything.
1296.86|1311.82|And I did that, and then I worked all summer by myself as a lineman by myself in towns where there was a plant, a diesel plant operating, and they could always give me a man maybe a half a day at a time, and then I worked by myself.
1311.84|1312.6|Saved my money.
1314.85|1318.63|On the 12th of October, they said, "Shut her down."
1318.69|1319.57|I was in East End.
1319.59|1320.55|They said, shut her down.
1320.65|1321.63|We've got no more money.
1323.32|1338.38|Well, again, those days you looked after yourself, and I had money in the bank, and I went, I wintered myself in a hotel where you could get a room for about $25 a month at that time, eat in a cafe for a dollar a day.
1340.02|1341.6|So you spent accordingly.
1341.62|1346.99|You spent 50 cents a day for pocket money, and you spent a dollar, the next day you didn't spend any.
1347.01|1349.93|That's the way it worked.
1351.06|1352.82|Do you remember there being
1353.07|1356.45|Who did the people blame for the depression?
1358.17|1359.34|Did people have any idea?
1359.36|1361.22|Did they say it was the government's fault?
1361.36|1362.14|Well, it's funny.
1362.6|1373.23|With myself, you know, there really was no depression as far as I was concerned, to get back to your other interviews.
1375.08|1377.92|I was never out of a dollar, never broke, you know.
1377.94|1379.54|I always had money in the bank.
1379.56|1380.66|Save it as you go.
1382.35|1389.52|The first that I noticed of the Depression was in the fall of '30, we were working in Biggar.
1390.28|1400.12|And every train that came through there, that was on the main line, if there's a hundred cars, box cars, there'd be men on every one of them.
1400.58|1402.02|Yeah, this is what the lady said.
1402.1|1404.8|And they had little sort of hobo jungles or something in each town.
1404.82|1405.0|Oh, yeah.
1405.7|1409.13|And these fellas would come out and go through the towns and
1409.65|1412.93|and go to the door and ask for sandwiches.
1412.95|1414.1|It was out of necessity.
1414.18|1416.9|If you get hungry, you'll do almost anything.
1416.92|1418.44|That was the first that I noticed.
1418.46|1419.6|But it still didn't bother me.
1419.72|1421.74|I had a job, you know.
1421.77|1427.33|It amazes me that they were putting electricity into the places when this was going on.
1427.35|1428.61|Oh, I was rebuilding.
1429.61|1432.32|No, but you said you wired a lot of homes in the same thing.
1432.36|1433.88|People were putting electricity into their house.
1433.94|1438.42|In Midale, I wired homes all winter in Midale in 19...
1438.42|1439.86|Who was paying for the wiring?
1440.06|1441.29|The people themselves.
1441.31|1445.69|But you wire a house, they'd put in an entrance, which cost $18 in those days.
1445.77|1449.01|Now, to get that plug put in now, it cost you $25.
1449.69|1456.18|But I'd put in the main entrance coming into a house for $18, and for $3, I'd put in an outlet or a light.
1456.2|1458.64|So they'd put in the very minimum.
1458.66|1462.19|You know, if they had five rooms, they'd put in five lights.
1462.27|1462.99|That was $15.
1463.01|1465.69|An 18, that's only $33.
1466.65|1468.08|And did most people have it put in?
1469.59|1478.28|Pretty well, I'd say 75 or 80 percent of the people, yes.
1478.72|1485.53|Well, there were some of the ones living in the small shacks, you know, and whatnot that didn't happen.
1485.55|1487.95|Did you know anybody that had to go on relief?
1489.39|1490.01|Oh, yes.
1491.01|1497.12|There were, while this is, later on, this carried on into
1497.5|1507.47|When I got back into Estevan again in 1937, all kinds of people were living off relief, right up until the war.
1508.55|1513.96|Did people treat them any differently than, you know, did they look down on them because they were taking relief?
1515.98|1517.28|Not necessarily.
1517.34|1518.66|It was a thing you accepted.
1518.99|1519.71|That's the way it was.
1519.93|1521.25|And people living in
1521.55|1529.43|you know, crowd into, like, you didn't live in a house like this, two people, you rented out every room to somebody if you only got $10 a month for it.
1529.45|1532.92|But to interject there for a minute, you said that people looked down on you if you were on relief.
1532.98|1536.58|No, because the lawyers, the only ones that weren't on relief were the bankers and the doctors.
1537.62|1541.35|The lawyers had the heels on their shoes, wore off, the same as everybody else.
1541.37|1546.79|My father objected to, he had to go down the city hall to get his relief, but they delivered it to the lawyers' house.
1546.81|1547.53|Oh, is that right?
1548.03|1550.13|I mean, there was... Yeah, a difference.
1550.15|1550.69|A difference.
1550.71|1551.35|But...
1552.36|1553.42|Everybody rented.
1553.46|1559.93|Like, again, I have to talk about Estevan and Bienfait, the coal mines where I knew every home.
1560.66|1566.09|I had 1,200 customers and knew them all, and they all knew me in the years that I was there.
1566.87|1569.79|And people were poor.
1570.37|1572.52|You were in sympathy with them.
1572.54|1575.06|I'd have to go and collect the light bills when they didn't pay, and I
1576.09|1580.81|The most heartbreaking thing, you'd go to a door and pound on the door, and here's a woman come to the door.
1580.83|1582.82|She had three, four little kids trailing her there.
1583.68|1588.9|And you were supposed to collect money because she was $5 behind on her light bill.
1588.92|1590.23|The government paid them $1.50.
1590.29|1590.79|On relief?
1593.15|1595.89|For lights, that was it, and anything over that they had to pay.
1597.18|1600.54|And that was one of the heartbreaking things, when you had to go out on collections.
1601.3|1604.53|And then, sure, we'd get the list, and here was the,
1605.18|1633.6|some big shot in town with 70 or 80 dollars and he he wasn't on the list to go human nature being what it is. But the relief came from the federal government did it federal yeah through the municipality yeah to get back to to uh how did it affect you the one winter the winter of 32 i had nothing to do and my brother was home on the farm
1634.29|1644.44|He said, "Well, I'll pay you this relief wage, which is $5 a month," is what the government used to pay, $5 a month for a man on the farm.
1645.71|1647.27|And he paid me $8 a month.
1647.49|1648.17|He gave me a bonus.
1648.23|1649.73|But I worked 12 hours a day.
1649.79|1651.78|We had a lot of livestock on the place.
1652.72|1653.42|I was busy.
1655.08|1657.81|Did you grow grain as well on the farm?
1657.83|1659.31|Oh, yeah, grain and livestock.
1659.33|1661.53|And did you always have good crops?
1661.53|1663.91|No, a lot of failures through the years.
1663.93|1666.31|So you had the drought down there as well?
1666.73|1668.05|Well, that came after.
1668.71|1674.76|The drought only came really after in the 30s when things started getting bad in that respect.
1675.22|1678.12|But by that time I was away from farming.
1678.24|1679.28|It didn't affect you then?
1679.72|1679.79|No.
1679.81|1681.87|Do you remember what the price of wheat might be?
1682.05|1683.41|Yeah, I had some.
1684.33|1689.69|One year I farmed, I had a few hundred bushels.
1690.23|1701.39|Well, I guess I could have sold it that fall for maybe a dollar or something, a bushel, and I thought, I'll hold it, it'll go up, and I wound up selling it for about 60 cents a bushel.
1701.41|1704.37|The wheat went as low as 30 cents a bushel.
1705.97|1711.52|But that area obviously didn't get completely dried out because you said you had gardens, farm gardens.
1711.86|1712.78|Yeah, that's right.
1712.8|1718.01|You could always grow a garden, but I don't know how.
1719.22|1722.69|The pastures were dried out.
1723.37|1725.19|You had to sell off your livestock.
1725.23|1727.93|The government wouldn't give you money if you couldn't grow hay.
1727.97|1733.28|The government wouldn't buy your hay, excepting for two cattle, two cows, that's all.
1733.3|1735.76|Things were tough in that respect.
1735.78|1739.19|And still, in our local area, there was not bad.
1739.95|1748.14|I was out west between Shaunavon and Assiniboia in 1935 and 1936, and there it was terrible.
1748.26|1749.18|And I might add,
1749.23|1758.52|when I was at Rosetown in 1937, that's on the main road north from Swift Current, the people were migrating up there.
1759.22|1760.66|It was an endless stream.
1761.48|1762.36|Migrating out of that area.
1762.5|1765.62|Out of the dry country down south of Swift Current going north.
1766.1|1778.34|You could go out on the highway and get up on a high area somewhere, and as far as the eye could see, there'd be one of these hay racks with a cow behind it, maybe a Bennett buggy like you see pictures of there.
1778.36|1778.58|Yeah, yeah.
1779.43|1807.72|And about every half mile, there'd be one of these, and the whole family, and up there... ...mile, there'd be one of these, and the whole family, and up there...
1808.05|1810.47|Taken a trek up, they went up into the Meadow Lake.
1810.49|1812.3|And a lot of them never came back, did they?
1812.32|1814.52|Oh, they did well up there.
1814.98|1823.51|In 1957, we built power lines up there, and these were the people that had migrated up there into the woods, had it all cleared out, and had beautiful farms.
1824.73|1832.94|Now, going back to the... Who did people blame for the Depression?
1832.96|1833.7|Government.
1834.88|1835.56|But it wasn't.
1836.18|1841.29|See, Saskatchewan was not only hit with the Depression, we were hit with the drought, which made it doubly bad.
1841.57|1842.63|Right.
1842.65|1845.37|Did people, were people politically involved, do you think?
1846.78|1847.9|Well, where else do you go?
1847.92|1849.62|You blame the government, you know.
1849.66|1851.02|Where are you going to go for help?
1851.9|1857.05|You start with the municipal level, and then the provincial level, and it finally winds up in Ottawa.
1857.39|1861.33|No, no, but I meant, did people, were people...
1861.34|1862.81|Did they have political opinions?
1863.43|1866.39|The other lady I talked to said that people weren't politically aware.
1866.53|1867.91|They tended to be small town.
1868.13|1869.21|Because we didn't have this.
1869.81|1874.36|Well, yeah, we had radios, but I'd say only half of the family.
1874.38|1877.36|I wouldn't say they blamed the government, Lindy. It was the drought.
1877.38|1879.45|Well, that's what they said.
1879.47|1881.83|I mean, you can't blame the government because you can't grow anything.
1881.85|1888.5|Yeah, but all this bunch you see pictures of train loads when they come through Ejani are going down to Ottawa to raise hell.
1888.82|1894.16|blame the government because they weren't, well, they didn't blame them for the drought, but they weren't getting anything for the farm.
1894.18|1898.73|But for the depression they were, for the crisis or something.
1898.75|1910.88|It was really, people were not as informed at that time as they are now.
1910.9|1915.04|And I say, God help us if it ever gets as bad now as it was then.
1915.61|1917.36|I'm afraid for what will happen.
1918.28|1921.38|Did they have any idea of how long, did people think it would last very long?
1922.82|1924.05|You never look ahead that far.
1925.13|1927.65|And I suppose because everybody was pretty well in the same predicament.
1927.67|1930.15|Everybody was in the same boat.
1930.21|1932.88|Farmers, you know, people were hard up.
1933.3|1944.15|I'll tell you where I noticed it most during the years, like I went to Iowa in 1931 and then I took my mother down again in 1938.
1945.84|1948.84|And when you got down there, there was no depression.
1949.32|1953.51|Well, financial matters, but people had everything.
1953.9|1957.59|When you went to church on Sunday, everybody was dressed so nice down there.
1957.89|1966.0|And here, when you went to church on Sunday, people were really dressed shabby in old coats and old clothes and everything.
1966.02|1966.68|It showed up.
1967.12|1971.96|But it never really did affect you as far as clothing and that kind of thing did?
1971.98|1973.79|One fellow told me, he said, "I always remember
1974.19|1983.0|you as a young man," he was about my age, and then he went out back and he said, "The only thing I could ever remember about you, you were always kind of a sporty dresser."
1983.4|1984.98|Well, I didn't think I was.
1985.14|1986.57|You had just yourself to keep.
1986.74|1990.11|That's why you didn't have a winter overcoat for three years.
1990.29|1992.31|You were married in 1938?
1994.5|1995.48|What did you say?
1995.51|1995.73|1940.
1995.75|1996.13|1940.
1996.59|1998.89|So you were married then after the Depression.
1998.97|2001.45|Yeah, that was one of the things that I saw.
2001.47|2005.62|These fellows getting married during the Depression, they didn't have anything in their homes.
2005.64|2010.29|They'd get in an old house someplace and have apple boxes with curtains on and so forth.
2010.31|2015.73|Well, I was brought up in a good home, and I said, "I'd never want to marry a girl and take her into a deal like that."
2015.85|2021.12|And I didn't have the wherewith to start a home.
2022.06|2023.76|So you intentionally didn't marry then?
2023.86|2028.89|Intentionally didn't get married until I... Good job the depression didn't go on a long, long time.
2029.03|2031.79|A couple more years.
2031.97|2033.52|I had one brother who never did marry.
2033.54|2034.12|He's a schoolteacher.
2034.14|2035.22|For the same reason, I suppose.
2035.84|2037.06|Yeah, he was a schoolteacher.
2037.12|2038.74|He never had enough money to get married.
2038.76|2044.25|Well, this other lady I was interviewing said that a lot of people were engaged for a long, long time just because they couldn't afford to get married.
2044.29|2045.49|I had a brother who was engaged for eight years.
2045.51|2046.21|Is that right?
2047.07|2048.51|Just couldn't afford to get married.
2050.51|2052.02|The other thing I wanted to know was about
2052.23|2055.38|what they did with their spare time, what you did socially.
2057.98|2067.71|Well, it's funny, even before you've gone here, when you get older, you think about things that come back to me.
2067.73|2080.16|When I was home on the farm, again, in the wintertime you're tied up, about four of us neighbor young gang would get together and we'd,
2080.9|2086.25|one house after the other would, this was stag, put on a party, stag party.
2087.23|2095.29|A couple of them were bachelors, the people were away on holidays, and we'd go there and play poker.
2096.33|2097.91|Used matches, a penny a match.
2098.11|2099.57|You didn't have that many pennies.
2100.63|2102.06|Sure, the Orsted boys.
2102.08|2104.82|The Orsted, a homemade beer?
2104.84|2106.54|No, we didn't drink at that time.
2106.6|2109.85|That was before beer came into being, before liquor came.
2110.16|2111.69|Those parties were dry.
2112.23|2115.53|Ice cream party and make cake and ice cream and all.
2115.55|2118.09|That's what we young fellas used to do.
2118.11|2122.2|And nobody made any, any, what do you call it?
2122.22|2122.64|Homebrew?
2122.82|2123.9|Yeah, homebrew.
2124.02|2124.82|No, not then.
2125.04|2126.58|Well, my dad always made wine.
2126.94|2128.82|My dad always made a barrel of wine every year.
2129.24|2129.66|And beer.
2130.95|2135.43|Well, then I started making beer, but that was in the 30s when we started making beer.
2136.01|2139.51|Yeah, in the years, when I was home on the farm, we made our own beer.
2139.97|2145.83|two cents a bottle for costs, and cost made beer just as good as you buy today.
2145.97|2148.49|Is that right?
2148.51|2149.72|Yeah.
2149.74|2153.38|So, and what did other people do for entertainment?
2153.4|2155.2|You know, there must have been a lot of men who were on it.
2155.22|2157.64|Now, you're talking about the Depression years, not before.
2157.66|2160.07|Yeah, I just want the Depression years.
2160.27|2161.49|Yeah, the Depression years.
2162.29|2163.69|You had schoolhouse dances.
2165.73|2168.99|As you know, every six miles through the country, there's a schoolhouse,
2169.23|2183.91|something like that. And a schoolhouse dance, and it would cost you 35 cents, and somebody put it on and paid the guy with the violin or the organ, whatever it was, and you had a lunch and everything for 35 cents.
2184.39|2186.89|That's more darn less than you could shake a stick at.
2187.03|2188.11|And I suppose everybody went.
2189.49|2195.1|Well, all the young people, oh, sure, they were always plugged, no matter how cold it was or how much snow it was.
2196.3|2197.66|You'd get there in the wintertime.
2198.76|2201.7|And then the small towns have a dance.
2201.76|2204.71|Maybe once a month you'd have a dance in your small town.
2204.75|2207.31|That was your entertainment.
2207.33|2208.21|And you had radio?
2209.66|2213.9|Yeah, we got a radio about 1923, I think, the first out.
2213.92|2222.63|I remember one dad, his dad came home one day with a radio with just headsets, and we used to put it in a bowl, and then we could all hear it.
2222.65|2223.66|In a bowl?
2224.16|2225.64|Open and amplify it, I suppose.
2225.66|2226.64|Yeah, like a big bowl.
2227.72|2229.8|What do you have those big bowls for?
2229.86|2230.48|Making bread.
2231.2|2235.13|Big ceramic bowl and put it in there and it echoed out.
2235.17|2238.05|That sounds like sitting under the towel to watch the TV.
2238.97|2242.38|I remember when they first came out the TVs were so snowy and you couldn't see them.
2242.4|2243.66|You had to sit with a towel over.
2243.96|2246.32|No, I've never experienced that.
2246.43|2247.55|Well, we're in the city here.
2247.57|2251.73|We always have pretty good reception.
2252.08|2256.65|Yeah, radios come out, and you'd listen to David McKee and Molly.
2257.53|2259.33|You read, you did a lot of reading.
2259.35|2268.08|I've seen at home, when I was home on the farm that winter, everything was read in the house.
2268.14|2270.52|You didn't have a library like this, you know.
2270.54|2273.38|You'd get a book from the neighbor, and you'd read it.
2273.97|2274.7|Pass it along.
2276.11|2279.83|Did the men who were unemployed, did they have a problem with their spare time?
2281.07|2289.59|They went out, and at that time we probably had 80 or 90,000 farms in Saskatchewan.
2291.25|2296.54|And the farmer was paid $5 a month to keep this fellow out there.
2296.56|2301.25|So the farmer, if he had a room, he'd get one of these men out there.
2301.27|2302.11|And did they pay you?
2302.13|2306.68|And that fellow, he was lucky if he got the $5, you know.
2307.6|2308.56|But he got room and board.
2308.58|2309.3|The farmer got paid.
2309.34|2314.69|He got room and board, and he kept busy, you know, something to do.
2315.03|2319.84|And everybody else was doing the same thing, you know, so it wasn't that bad.
2320.8|2324.6|Do you know anything about what they did for medical care?
2326.65|2330.19|Was there any medical aid or things for these people?
2330.21|2333.64|I never knew of anyone dying excepting one woman, a neighbor woman.
2333.66|2335.62|I had about probably her.
2336.39|2344.88|10th or 12th baby, and she died from childbirth. Just a neighbor a couple miles away.
2344.9|2349.43|I never knew of anybody dying from want of medicine.
2349.63|2351.69|Did they have a doctor and a nurse?
2351.71|2355.75|We had a doctor at Griffin, which was 10 miles away, but that wasn't our town.
2355.91|2359.24|Mydale doctor was the one that would come out.
2360.3|2364.1|But for a doctor to come to the farm in the wintertime is almost unheard of.
2364.78|2366.7|So you did most of the doctoring yourself?
2367.12|2370.18|Oh, yeah.
2370.32|2372.79|I remember sticking a fork into my foot one time.
2373.31|2376.41|A few hours I had blood poison.
2376.43|2379.76|But you had some home remedy and you cured it.
2379.78|2382.66|So one of the more people didn't die, didn't you?
2384.82|2391.17|I remember that one was hot coals in a pail and throw some wool rags and put a blanket over and put your foot in.
2391.57|2393.75|I don't know whether it's the heat or the smoke that...
2393.99|2397.59|I remember doing it.
2397.79|2400.39|I stuck a nail in my foot and I can remember they had to soak it.
2400.42|2403.5|So it wasn't supposed to be the same thing.
2403.52|2404.48|Well, in fact, you didn't.
2404.58|2405.68|Yeah, well, they'd be contaminated.
2406.08|2409.53|I remember this was in the summertime, too.
2409.55|2411.09|I had an attack to appendicitis.
2411.11|2414.36|That was that summer when I was home on the farm about 33.
2414.96|2416.76|I was out pitching bundles folded over.
2416.78|2418.44|I had such a pain in here.
2418.46|2421.01|Later on, for a couple of days, one whole day later,
2421.47|2424.26|in bed putting cold irons on there.
2424.44|2426.06|That was supposed to be good for it.
2426.4|2427.54|Oh, it went away.
2427.58|2435.19|I've never had an operation of this game.
2435.43|2439.03|I never heard of anyone dying for want of medicine.
2439.65|2441.99|Did you have soup kitchens and that kind of thing in your town?
2442.19|2442.53|No.
2443.13|2444.07|It was too small.
2444.09|2444.39|No.
2444.86|2448.72|See, small communities had a big advantage.
2448.74|2450.84|Everybody sort of looked after everybody.
2451.24|2451.86|What, shared?
2452.47|2454.07|Food and that sort of thing?
2454.09|2455.07|Well, I don't know.
2455.11|2457.37|If you saw somebody that needed help, you helped them.
2457.99|2460.24|That was...
2460.26|2464.8|So you don't think the government did much, really, then, to alleviate any of the problems?
2464.82|2468.19|They didn't... Well, the municipalities handled it.
2469.83|2473.57|You could get help, financial help, from the municipalities.
2473.59|2476.4|Well, they sent in salt fish and apples.
2476.58|2477.84|Oh, yeah, the government sent... From the east.
2477.9|2478.6|From the east.
2479.12|2480.64|Did everybody get that?
2480.76|2482.31|Oh, yeah.
2482.81|2484.49|The mother said, I don't want any.
2484.71|2487.62|The storekeeper said, you get in there and get your box of apples.
2488.42|2489.54|You're entitled to it.
2489.56|2490.42|It's for everybody.
2490.74|2491.28|Is that right?
2491.3|2495.13|The mother very reluctantly took a box of apples.
2497.24|2498.8|If you were self-sufficient,
2499.98|2501.54|You lived on a farm.
2501.58|2503.2|You could basically survive.
2503.86|2504.37|You had a cow.
2504.39|2510.28|You didn't have much money, but you could sell your eggs, you could sell your odd chicken, you had your vegetables, you had your meat.
2511.36|2513.32|So you bought a little sugar and a little salt.
2514.02|2517.35|But if you lived in town, you were on relief, period.
2517.99|2520.65|But it goes back again.
2520.85|2525.68|The guy took 100 pounds of flour home and a half of pork for a couple of bucks and a
2526.67|2528.3|They got through the winter somehow.
2528.42|2533.1|But they didn't allow, I mean, anybody who owned a store didn't allow much credit, did they?
2534.2|2536.39|Oh, yeah.
2536.43|2539.83|They did up to a point where it would hurt them.
2539.85|2540.81|And then they cut them off.
2540.85|2541.76|Then they cut it off.
2541.78|2543.02|Yeah.
2543.22|2545.12|Small towns, small communities.
2545.7|2548.84|It was the same with neighbors.
2548.93|2556.28|We had neighbors, well, this was even before the Depression, that didn't have feed or anything for their animals, and we were -
2556.9|2559.46|The guy wanted to know if he could get a load of straw.
2559.64|2562.92|Well, he came up there with a team of horses that could hardly pull the empty sleigh.
2563.86|2565.91|And they were so hard up for feed.
2566.59|2569.41|So dad said to us, boys, well, load them up a load of straw.
2569.43|2569.97|Brought it in.
2570.37|2573.63|Then he said to another one, he said, "Hitch a team of horses on and pull them home."
2573.65|2574.73|He was two miles away.
2575.59|2577.41|But you help people like that.
2577.61|2581.22|And maybe throw some oats in, too, so that he could feed his horses.
2582.98|2586.26|It must have been awfully desperate for people, though, who had big families.
2586.73|2587.37|No job.
2587.43|2591.88|Yeah, of course, there again, as I said, our home never suffered that way.
2591.9|2593.7|We're one of the...
2593.72|2596.46|But you did help other people, didn't you?
2596.48|2597.42|Oh, yeah, you're sure.
2597.96|2599.34|I always helped other people.
2599.44|2602.97|So there was a sense of community and a sense of closeness more than there is now.
2603.69|2604.91|Oh, very definitely.
2604.93|2605.87|It was so different.
2606.93|2610.39|I can remember this neighbor lady that I got when mother was sick.
2611.73|2612.95|And this after dad was dead.
2613.78|2616.0|They were going to sell out, go back to Illinois.
2616.64|2617.92|And her son took sick.
2617.94|2621.0|She just had the one son who was about my age.
2621.02|2627.95|So she asked if I'd come up and get them ready for an auction sale, all their livestock and machinery and everything.
2627.97|2630.29|And I went up there and I worked like a slave.
2630.31|2633.22|Besides doing the chores at home, then I'd go up and work there.
2633.26|2638.5|And I got all our horses trimmed up and dressed up for the sale and everything arranged.
2638.52|2640.67|Got neighbors in and we dug out the machinery.
2640.71|2645.71|And all the while, she kept saying, oh, Linda and I don't know what I'd do without you.
2646.17|2649.53|I will pay you a bell, she'd always say, I will pay you a bell.
2649.81|2651.71|When I was all over, she'd give me a $5 bill.
2651.83|2653.95|I'd worked up there about 10 days.
2656.06|2656.86|Well, she did that.
2656.88|2657.36|But you felt good.
2658.12|2659.88|Well, it didn't hurt me.
2659.92|2660.1|No.
2660.52|2671.47|Another neighbor, almost in the same direction, he was a bachelor, and he got me to come and take his horses in off of the prairie and trim them up and everything.
2671.49|2673.38|He always used that term.
2673.39|2674.36|He's a Scandinavian.
2674.42|2675.72|I pay you a bell, I pay you a bell.
2676.27|2680.78|He gave me a mahogany table about that big.
2680.8|2682.38|That was the pay I got for it.
2683.38|2688.69|So do you think people did a lot of trading then?
2688.71|2695.74|Sort of like barter, rather than paying cash for things, they'd bring barter or whatever?
2695.84|2699.15|No, I never saw any of that go on in the small towns, really.
2699.41|2702.93|Well, the barber in Mydale, he's still living.
2702.95|2704.35|He's over 100 years old.
2704.94|2706.04|He would do that.
2706.12|2717.6|He would trim hair for butter, or cream, or potatoes, or eggs, what have you.
2718.1|2721.51|But you're out on the road, and you had to pull in someplace for two or three hours.
2721.55|2722.83|You're afraid to be out on the road.
2723.45|2727.16|You couldn't see the length of a car in front of you.
2727.98|2729.92|And that would go on for days, I suppose, wouldn't it?
2729.94|2731.84|Day and night sometimes, yeah.
2731.86|2732.92|Did that affect people?
2735.05|2739.03|No, you got accustomed to being dirty all the time, you know.
2740.53|2745.76|I can remember working in Shaunavon in 1936.
2747.72|2751.74|And we were overhauling the power line that runs from Shaunavon to Assiniboia.
2752.2|2754.53|And we would go out every morning, a nice bright morning.
2756.01|2764.6|And by the time the sun got up good and it got hot, the wind would start up and by 11 o'clock in the morning you had a hit for cover.
2764.78|2767.72|It just seemed to create a draft, you know.
2767.74|2769.95|It'd come all the way from Lethbridge down.
2769.97|2772.31|The whole country was like a desert.
2773.72|2775.6|And they said, "Well, it's finished.
2775.62|2777.04|It'll never grow anything again.
2777.1|2780.41|The whole country is just..." Gophers starved to death.
2780.43|2782.01|It was that bad.
2782.03|2783.31|Birds starved to death.
2783.45|2785.36|Yeah, because nothing grew, I guess.
2785.5|2788.98|Nothing grew except in Russian pistols, and they'd get about so high.
2790.72|2792.16|But it did rain sometimes.
2792.36|2795.94|Well, and it started raining, and they grew 20 crops in a row after that.
2795.96|2797.57|Well, of course all it did was just shift.
2797.91|2800.71|They had missed just about 20 crops, too.
2800.73|2804.71|They kept trying to grow crops, but couldn't make it.
2804.73|2818.75|Did you find that there was any prejudice around in your area, like people who had immigrated into, you know, people from Europe or different places, that people feel that there was enough to go around or not enough, and they weren't willing to care?
2825.51|2833.41|I don't know what you refer to when you say prejudices, people coming in from outside communities.
2833.81|2838.91|That was a normal thing, people moving around from areas, you know.
2838.93|2844.46|We were almost a strictly American Eastern Canadian settlement there.
2844.48|2851.66|And the first that we saw of anyone that had any, what we call foreign blood in them,
2853.27|2855.98|They would be from German extraction, I guess.
2856.24|2857.9|They came in from Maple Creek.
2857.92|2861.22|They had gone out in that area, and they totally dried out.
2861.28|2864.27|But they were some of the ones that came through with horses and wagons.
2864.85|2868.53|They'd come into our district, and if there's a vacant farm, they got on it.
2869.7|2876.88|And people, you know, you come there one year, there's one, and three years, there's a half a dozen more.
2877.44|2881.48|So they finally come in, and now basically that's what's in the community.
2881.5|2883.16|Did people resent them coming in?
2883.18|2883.39|No.
2883.51|2883.77|No?
2884.17|2885.71|They treated them just the same as...
2887.11|2889.29|It was one of the things you accepted.
2889.31|2891.88|You felt sorry for the guy, you know.
2892.54|2895.3|It sounds to me like there was a real sense of neighborliness then.
2895.76|2898.58|Well, there had to be a case of survival.
2899.02|2901.61|That's how you did it.
2901.93|2906.77|Do you remember the church being very involved in any of the volunteers or anything?
2906.79|2906.85|No.
2907.41|2912.09|The church paid no attention to it whatever.
2912.97|2919.54|They had no, now I couldn't speak for, well I can speak for Estevan too.
2919.56|2925.12|I never saw anything organized there really, or Weyburn.
2925.14|2927.11|We're in a small community in Halbrite.
2927.2|2929.23|We're the only church between the two places.
2929.79|2936.99|But there's never anything done for the poor or anything, not like we're doing today.
2937.21|2963.15|in any of the churches there of course i suppose the churches is you know the people in the church didn't have any money either so i suppose that would be well the church is the people put it that way. Yeah do you remember when it started to get better well yes about 1942,
2965.34|2967.85|let's see.
2967.87|2969.31|So after the war started, eh?
2969.35|2970.83|When the war started, yeah.
2970.85|2973.58|Then you could see things starting to pick up a little bit.
2974.2|2979.3|Did a lot of the young men go into war because they hadn't had a job, do you think?
2979.32|2980.7|Oh, yeah, that was a...
2981.42|2983.3|just like that, into the Army.
2983.64|2985.55|Because it was a guaranteed wage.
2985.57|2987.07|Then relief was cut off.
2987.09|2988.27|It was harder to get relief.
2988.45|2989.41|Well, they cut off relief.
2989.43|2991.47|Married men and everybody into the Army.
2992.77|2994.96|I never joined the Army on the account of that.
2995.06|2996.52|I was a tradesman.
2996.54|2999.68|I was a journeyman electrician.
2999.7|3003.43|And I could have gone into the Navy with a ranking.
3003.91|3005.87|And then I was just married two years.
3005.95|3007.37|And Phyllis and I talked it over.
3007.39|3011.29|And I was tied to my job.
3012.1|3015.99|But you said they cut the relief off as soon as the war started?
3016.31|3018.63|Well, not immediately, but it soon followed.
3018.65|3020.43|In other words, as a means of getting people into the army.
3020.47|3021.8|As fast as they could mobilize.
3021.82|3022.76|Is that right?
3022.82|3024.68|Do you remember them having conscription?
3026.16|3026.58|Oh, yeah.
3026.62|3028.75|Well, I was up for conscription.
3029.81|3031.81|What did people feel about that?
3032.57|3033.91|That's the way it should be.
3033.93|3034.69|Is that right, eh?
3034.83|3035.33|Oh, yeah.
3035.35|3038.48|There weren't people, they didn't oppose to the idea of conscription at all?
3038.54|3039.76|No, I never heard anyone.
3040.32|3040.4|Huh?
3040.42|3042.48|Because it was so different than that in the East.
3042.66|3045.07|A lot of people were really, really opposed to conscription.
3045.09|3049.61|Well, of course, well, we had a war just before that.
3049.65|3056.74|The World War was only 20 years old when this one - had ended, only 20 years when this one, like the one that started.
3057.11|3060.25|You know, a lot of patriotism.
3060.27|3060.67|Down here.
3062.45|3065.24|More so than there is today, I think.
3065.44|3066.5|Although we don't know.
3066.52|3068.78|If a war started in ... you'd probably see it.
3068.8|3071.57|Yeah, but I think they had more links to Britain then.
3071.61|3078.89|People felt more, because Britain was at war, that Canada should go at war, too, because it was that tie.
3079.29|3081.26|I don't know if they would now.
3081.28|3083.0|Canada's much more independent.
3083.02|3087.0|Well, a lot of them probably.
3087.66|3089.47|We haven't got unemployment yet.
3089.49|3091.47|It's not bad yet.
3091.97|3096.91|If you talk about unemployment, I'll get back to that when I was in Saskatoon in the spring of '31.
3097.04|3104.92|I saw lines of traveling men, travelers, taken off of the road.
3104.94|3106.79|I don't know if they still have them or not.
3107.67|3112.71|The guys that used to go from town to town and take orders for things and sell things.
3112.73|3113.79|Like traveling salesmen.
3113.83|3115.54|From the wholesale houses.
3116.26|3120.44|I've seen lineups, two abreast, three city blocks long
3121.25|3129.5|waiting to get lined up down to the employment office, or else the relief, where they got relief.
3129.52|3131.14|That was the first guy that suffered.
3131.16|3136.93|It was a fellow that was not out producing anything, you know.
3137.07|3137.91|He went first.
3138.63|3142.1|Now, I wouldn't be surprised to see that come again right now, you know.
3142.12|3143.58|They talk about unemployment now.
3143.6|3146.16|I said, "No, that's..."
3146.19|3150.51|I don't call that unemployment what we've got now, not what I see.
3150.71|3172.35|it's conditions are so bad for it now. When I went into this small town of Tompkins to build a power line in the fall of '33 in that small town there were about 300 maybe 275 300 people living there, and I went in there by myself.
3173.66|3175.98|And now I have to get a crew of eight, ten men.
3176.74|3180.67|I could have picked up 30 young men just like that in that small town.
3180.71|3182.25|Good young men.
3182.27|3185.49|I had to almost fight them off to keep them from working.
3186.31|3191.94|Did the government, when did they start putting the power into these towns?
3191.96|3195.04|When did the government take over the Power Commission, did you say?
3195.06|3200.11|Well, the Power Commission started in 1928.
3200.41|3208.86|Do you think that they persisted with this and went through and took over all these corporations as a means of employment?
3209.32|3212.3|No, it was sort of a natural evolution.
3214.02|3215.6|It's funny you should ask that question.
3215.66|3218.19|I just finished reading a book by Clinton White.
3218.21|3219.75|He's a university professor.
3219.79|3220.19|Do you know him?
3220.85|3224.47|I want to phone him and congratulate him on that book.
3224.55|3224.93|I read it.
3226.67|3230.4|I knew most of the people involved right from the time it was formed.
3231.0|3240.51|But I wasn't involved, like he explained, all the things that went on between the private companies and the Power Commission, and how it all came about.
3240.91|3241.91|But it all happened.
3242.21|3246.62|Whether in Alberta they didn't have a power commission, the same thing happened in Alberta.
3246.64|3248.06|It's happened here.
3248.42|3250.04|Sort of a natural evolution.
3250.18|3255.24|Invention, economic conditions, and everything got right for it.
3255.26|3257.53|And it needed to be done, so they went ahead and did it.
3257.67|3260.37|It needed to be done, and they got new methods.
3260.53|3264.88|were evolved through the years, and it all came about.
3264.96|3270.59|Tommy Douglas always said, you know, we give all the foreigners power.
3271.38|3276.43|Well, we'd have got power no matter if they were liberal or conservative.
3276.47|3279.81|What government was in Regina?
3279.85|3280.96|When they took over,
3281.61|3283.67|The CCF had just come in.
3283.79|3286.84|They came in in 1942, I think, when they came in.
3287.02|3290.59|No, but who was in power over the Depression?
3291.97|3294.45|Oh, the Anderson government came in.
3294.67|3298.86|That was a Conservative, or what did they call them, a united government.
3298.88|3299.48|Progressive.
3299.5|3300.46|Progressive.
3301.72|3303.02|They lasted four years.
3303.53|3309.05|They came in when things were just starting to get bad, and then they just
3309.22|3313.12|gotten worse and when they went out they never got a seat in 4 years.
3314.0|3317.29|Now that tells you that people are blaming the government.
3317.79|3326.13|You remember hearing about Bennett just before the election he promised a whole lot of things like employment insurance and all these kind of things?
3327.16|3336.96|Well as I say we were not as informed then but I can remember that he was supposed to when he came in he was going to turn the whole world around you know.
3337.48|3339.49|And in four years, nothing happened.
3339.51|3341.19|So people just gave up?
3341.25|3342.29|No, just like that.
3342.31|3345.94|But nothing happened after the Liberal government came in either, did there?
3345.96|3348.16|No, it was the same thing.
3348.18|3349.86|It stalled, stalled.
3349.88|3352.75|They couldn't find answers until the war came.
3353.21|3355.95|I always say, give Hitler credit.
3356.61|3365.25|He put a stop to the Depression in North America, starting that war, and that made work.
3366.04|3372.56|And from there we come back and we build up and now we've hit another dead end.
3372.84|3373.97|We'll probably have another war.
3374.39|3375.19|We could see it.
3376.27|3378.03|You could see this dead end coming.
3379.73|3382.03|I could see it for the last five years.
3382.17|3385.82|I've said there's too much of everything.
3389.34|3392.48|We've out manufactured ourselves.
3393.95|3396.85|It's all right to obviously, well, people should buy more cars.
3398.57|3401.32|Yeah, you can only use so many cars.
3402.78|3409.13|But I could see it in my own uneducated way in Regina here.
3409.67|3415.38|The use car lots, plug full, plug full, wherever you go, every small town, Weyburn, Estevan.
3416.11|3426.11|The towns in between, all plugged full of used, good-used cars, not junk cars, good-used cars, so they reach the saturation points.
3426.14|3427.14|Go through the stores.
3427.18|3433.46|The stores are plugged so full of merchandise, and they're still packing it in there more and more all the time.
3434.54|3437.81|Our own home here, the clothes closets, everything plugged right full.
3437.83|3438.99|You couldn't put any more in.
3439.83|3444.91|That's different than during the Depression, too, isn't it, because people tended to value things more?
3445.16|3446.32|You don't keep them longer?
3446.53|3449.09|Well, everybody does as the Joneses do.
3449.11|3450.45|You wore the same suit.
3450.47|3455.74|This fellow said her dad probably wore the same overcoat for 10, 15 years.
3456.94|3459.62|Today, if a guy did that, you'd say, "What's wrong with that guy?
3459.64|3461.0|He can't buy a new overcoat."
3461.02|3464.15|But nobody else is doing the same.
3464.33|3465.95|Sure, everybody else is doing the same.
3467.09|3467.55|Except you.
3469.97|3471.32|You were living very well.
3471.62|3473.82|Well, I didn't live extravagantly.
3474.49|3488.91|I say now, though, in those years when I was a migrant lineman, I had a suitcase, a club bag, and I could put the rest of the stuff in a carton that I owned.
3488.93|3490.71|You kept yourself down to the basics.
3490.73|3493.68|You always had a good suit, an extra pair of pants.
3494.04|3496.58|You didn't have two jackets.
3496.6|3498.53|When you wore the pants, you wore a sweater with it.
3498.79|3501.6|That's easy to pack, you know.
3502.28|3505.62|And a good pair of dress shoes, and that was, that's all.
3506.14|3509.19|Yeah, nobody had any frills or anything, they just had the bare necessities.
3509.21|3511.57|That's right, and that's the way you lived.
3511.59|3517.64|Do you think that living during the Depression has affected anything that you do now?
3518.04|3518.46|Everything.
3519.62|3519.82|How?
3520.4|3520.76|Save.
3522.83|3523.29|You save.
3523.53|3526.79|I'm still frugal on everything I do.
3528.14|3532.0|And that was just because you were, that was the way you did.
3532.06|3535.12|And you saved during the depression.
3535.14|3537.99|Sure, I saved during the depression when things were tough, I saved.
3538.01|3538.95|You always save.
3538.97|3545.82|So that was just sort of a form of, your form of security, your way of handling that. In case you got laid off or something like that, was it?
3545.84|3546.86|Yeah, that's right.
3546.88|3549.9|Same when I started my own business, when I started contracting.
3550.98|3553.72|I always never went ahead until I
3555.19|3557.87|until I saw the finances on my own.
3557.89|3562.06|I didn't go to the banker and say, here, I've got to have $10,000 to do this or that.
3562.16|3566.42|I'd wait until I had the $10,000, and then I'd make my move.
3567.08|3573.05|In other words, you never knew when it was going to stop all through the 20 years that I contracted.
3573.07|3577.66|We were contracting for the government here, and they were building up and building up and building up.
3577.68|3582.22|And they almost had us out of business, building up their own forces.
3582.71|3600.59|and until the government changed.
3606.83|3619.21|We were contracting for the government here, and they were building up and building up and building up, and they almost had us out of business, building up their own forces until the government changed.
3621.16|3624.57|And then I was burnt out by that time, and I quit just from...
3624.66|3625.62|patcher.
3626.49|3631.83|But in other words, you got so that you didn't depend on the government for anything to provide any of the security.
3631.97|3638.88|So it didn't matter to you whether you had unemployment insurance or old age pension or all these kind of things then because you figured you would save and look after yourself.
3638.9|3641.83|I did that for myself because I'd always looked after myself, yes.
3643.21|3645.69|And I think we'd be better off if we had more of that now.
3646.37|3646.89|I agree.
3646.91|3648.94|I think the government's taken over too much of that.
3649.0|3653.74|When a person comes to a job and the first thing he asks is, what's your pension system here?
3654.38|3657.28|he's looking for something to ride on right there.
3657.86|3662.65|Although a lot of the jobs now you can't, you're not able to save, I don't think.
3663.13|3671.68|Well, then I'll use an old corny saying, it's not the, today the problem is not the cost of living, it's the cost of the way we live.
3672.42|3674.0|It's the big thing.
3674.06|3679.47|We all have our expectations so high that, and you can get that way.
3679.87|3683.37|And the same person that is that way, if they had to, they could go back to the
3683.71|3691.34|The house with apple boxes and cans and pans just enough to get along with a human is a funny creature, you know.
3691.68|3696.22|You can do with luxury and you can do with the bare necessity.
3696.98|3698.76|I saw some of that during the Depression.
3698.82|3702.49|I saw a farmer just out of our hometown that always rode high and mighty.
3703.19|3712.12|When things got tough, he really got out and drove a team of horses in the field, wore overalls when he was a man 70 years old.
3712.3|3713.58|This was out of necessity.
3713.66|3723.18|He did it very humbly and he was a better citizen in a small town then than when he was when he was riding high and mighty.
3723.24|3736.99|Were there very many people in a town who, like were there opportunists who took over other people's farms because they had the money, bought up property and businesses or anything like that?
3737.1|3741.33|Really never saw it in those days, not when I was...
3741.53|3744.91|So everybody in town was in the same fix then?
3745.76|3754.23|The only people, farmers, they would be mortgaged with a mortgage company, and I guess they still are today in the same way.
3754.27|3764.74|Maybe much worse today because it's so easy to get money today from the government and what not to keep agriculture alive.
3765.49|3774.2|Agriculture, as I see it, having lived here all my life, is a struggle from day one, and it's still a struggle.
3774.42|3778.13|There's a few that get on top and really make it.
3778.15|3785.3|All this high-priced land and everything, it's not that the land is worth that much.
3785.32|3787.84|It's people with so much money, they don't know what to do with it.
3787.86|3791.09|So they say, I'm going to go and buy a couple sections of land.
3791.49|3793.51|How big would the town be that you were in?
3794.05|3798.72|Oh, when we came to Halbrite in 1907, it was about 700 people.
3798.78|3803.09|No, but in the 30s, when you were, where were you in the 30s?
3803.33|3805.85|Yeah, well, Midale was about 250 people.
3805.91|3809.94|That was my headquarters for a small town.
3810.24|3812.2|No, I didn't have general stores.
3813.62|3817.51|I had one general store.
3817.53|3819.03|You could buy a suit of clothes there, maybe.
3819.28|3821.28|So you did all your dealing right there in town.
3821.3|3826.25|Basically, you went to Weyburn and Estevan for those things.
3826.27|3827.21|Did they use the candles?
3828.45|3829.81|Did they use Eaton's candles?
3830.45|3830.64|Oh, yeah.
3830.66|3841.55|I saw Dad one time, about 19 or 20, had made up a big order for our winter clothes.
3841.57|3846.47|He went to town and came home, and here he had the order.
3847.2|3849.14|Everything, except one or two things.
3850.65|3853.44|And how could you get it so fast?
3854.32|3856.04|He said, "J.P. Shum took the order."
3856.06|3857.86|He said, I can sell that at that price.
3857.88|3863.87|He had a pretty good general store, including a fur coat in it.
3864.05|3866.02|Is that right?
3866.1|3868.62|Not a mink coat or anything, but a fur coat.
3869.06|3871.55|One of my older brothers, he wanted a good warm overcoat.
3871.57|3877.23|He said, "I want this warm overcoat, maybe $39 or something."
3877.69|3879.17|What did all your family do?
3879.19|3884.34|Now, you said there were 13 of you, and you and your younger brother ran the farm.
3884.38|3886.4|Now, did the girls all marry off?
3886.54|3890.5|Well, I have to go back now to you say, why did Dad leave Iowa and come up here?
3891.51|3898.79|They had land promoters coming down there and saying the opportunity up in Canada.
3898.81|3905.8|They used to put on excursions, give them a free ride up into Canada, and I suppose lots of food and everything.
3906.44|3910.51|and drive them out in the country and say, here's the kind of land you can buy.
3910.53|3912.99|And it was virtually all prairie at that time.
3913.57|3915.13|You know, there were some farms starting up.
3916.16|3918.14|And Dad had eight sons.
3918.68|3921.84|What do I want with this $80 an acre land in Iowa?
3921.94|3923.33|That's what farmland was worth.
3923.81|3925.19|Up here, he bought it for $20.
3926.85|3929.55|And I'll have a quarter section for each one of the sons.
3931.44|3933.68|Well, none of the sons stayed on the farm.
3934.54|3938.24|Okay, so now, the older boys, they left before the Depression.
3938.26|3940.16|Yeah, the oldest boy, he left the first fall.
3940.18|3947.31|He became 21 in November, and he left and went back to the States, and he never came back up.
3947.33|3951.64|The second one, he was a year younger or something like that.
3952.8|3957.33|He left, he went, he homesteaded out by Okama, and then he went grain buying.
3957.37|3959.33|He spent his life as a grain buyer.
3960.27|3961.75|And the next one is John.
3962.91|3964.49|He tried farming.
3964.86|3970.33|And it didn't work out, so at that time, the big trek to California, so he goes to California.
3970.77|3972.01|Didn't know what he was going to do.
3972.65|3976.26|Charles, the next one, he follows up, he goes to California.
3976.3|3978.64|Joe, he left and he went to California.
3979.6|3981.95|And Sylvester, he got to be a schoolteacher.
3982.65|3984.71|He stayed in Saskatchewan.
3984.73|3986.15|And he is younger or older than you?
3986.35|3987.15|They're all older.
3987.19|3988.4|All older.
3989.44|3990.5|I'm the next one.
3990.88|3995.87|And I spent my life in Saskatchewan, you might say outside of two years in the States.
3996.95|4004.66|And then Milton, the eighth one, he was on the farm.
4004.68|4013.08|Well, he farmed but lived in town, but always, never farmed big, just enough to make a living and so on.
4013.72|4016.72|And the girls all married off, and they lived in Saskatchewan?
4016.74|4017.48|Two became nuns.
4017.92|4019.17|Just one married.
4019.45|4022.25|Second, one just younger than me, she married.
4022.91|4023.69|She died young.
4023.73|4026.52|She was only in her early 30s when she died.
4026.94|4029.32|California, she's in California.
4029.36|4031.13|California must have had a real attraction, eh?
4031.15|4031.53|It did.
4031.63|4034.17|I mean, John must have sent back some glowing stories.
4035.74|4037.86|I - no it wasn't.
4037.88|4040.16|Yeah, I guess it was that good when he first went down.
4040.22|4042.22|And that's from the other Achen family.
4042.24|4044.75|There were nine girls and four boys in that family.
4044.77|4046.21|They lived just a mile away.
4046.23|4047.85|Now, what other Achen family is that?
4047.87|4048.89|That was my dad's brother.
4049.17|4050.21|Oh.
4050.25|4051.75|So they came up from Iowa together?
4052.47|4055.13|No, they came up five years after us.
4055.37|4056.9|After.
4056.92|4061.26|And so they migrated to California.
4061.28|4061.52|All of them?
4061.54|4065.64|Well, first the oldest girl, and then the mother, and the father,
4066.2|4070.89|And a pair of twins about 15 years old and two more girls went down.
4071.07|4074.43|They all migrated and lots of them, they still sell them.
4074.45|4075.84|Is that right?
4076.32|4077.26|Three girls living.
4077.44|4082.61|One girl's in Arizona and one in Victoria.
4082.63|4084.71|But it's funny, they all scattered.
4084.81|4087.6|It didn't turn out the way Dad had it planned at all.
4088.62|4096.21|The other thing I was just thinking about, you said that single men never had a problem getting a job as opposed to married men.
4099.5|4105.82|No, because the company looked at it, here's a guy, you know, that he can be a migrant.
4105.86|4108.01|We don't want him, well, we can get rid of him.
4108.03|4110.17|If he's married, you have a responsibility.
4110.19|4116.76|I know this other lady was saying that she was a schoolteacher, and when she married, she had to quit.
4117.48|4120.18|They wouldn't have people who were married being schoolteachers.
4120.68|4122.53|Yeah.
4122.61|4125.97|Well, I run a business for 20 years, and I was the same.
4126.11|4128.09|I always hired single men.
4128.23|4128.75|Yeah, I suppose.
4128.77|4131.82|Do you remember the big trek that came through Regina?
4132.26|4135.46|All those young men who were unemployed, and they had them in the labor camps.
4136.02|4138.82|And they came here, and they had the riot.
4138.84|4139.77|Do you remember that?
4141.31|4143.35|Oh, yeah, I remember that there again.
4143.43|4147.23|But that was an accumulation of men right from Victoria through, you see.
4147.92|4151.67|They weren't from the district here or anything like that.
4151.69|4154.37|What did people think about it?
4154.39|4156.89|They didn't pay much attention to it.
4156.91|4163.98|The same, I drove into Estevan after they had the big strike, the coal miner strike down there and shot two or three guys.
4164.48|4168.2|I drove into town and they had martial law on and I didn't know what was wrong.
4168.22|4171.01|It was so quiet, about five in the afternoon.
4171.47|4175.19|I stopped at a service station and the guy said, "I said, what's happened, Jack?"
4175.21|4176.17|There's nobody around.
4176.19|4176.63|He said,
4177.28|4178.87|"Got martial law here, he said."
4178.89|4181.79|It's just a big riot here this afternoon.
4181.81|4182.99|I hadn't heard a thing about it.
4183.01|4186.46|I didn't pay much attention to it either.
4186.48|4188.6|It was one of those things that happened.
4188.62|4192.71|So people really weren't in sympathy much with these people who went on strike then, were they?
4194.25|4199.92|Excepting the miners, because everybody else didn't pay too much attention to it.
4199.94|4202.8|Were there very many of the unions developed?
4202.82|4205.37|That's, yeah, they were developing unions
4206.46|4207.32|at that time.
4208.59|4209.95|Were people enthusiastic?
4211.13|4211.67|Pardon?
4211.71|4214.18|Were people glad that this was happening, the unions?
4214.19|4215.42|Did they think they were a good idea?
4215.44|4217.62|No, they didn't pay much attention to it, but the miners.
4218.7|4222.87|Anybody who didn't have anything much, they were the ones who were the moral sort of ones.
4222.89|4222.99|Yeah.
4223.01|4225.69|Well, the miners were getting a bad deal, there's no doubt about it.
4225.75|4229.1|But things were tough, I mean, for the mine company to make it go too.
4230.64|4232.39|Were there many people who were communist?
4233.68|4248.7|Well, they said the guy that came in there, this Annie Buller, she's a woman from Winnipeg, and what was the other fellow's name, the ringleader, they said "He's a communist, but he was making a living organizing."
4248.72|4253.45|That was the same as all these McDermott we have down in Ottawa now.
4253.47|4254.57|He's got a job to do.
4254.59|4260.02|He's got to holler and castigate all the big companies and everything for treating his men so bad.
4260.04|4262.85|How does he earn $100,000 a year if you don't?
4263.62|4271.24|So it sounds like that anybody who was sort of making go of it, they didn't bother politically or they weren't involved in the unions.
4271.28|4273.77|They were just glad to be left alone.
4273.81|4279.45|It was only the people who were really, really hurting or on relief that sort of got involved in those kind of things, were they?
4280.57|4282.57|Well, I don't know.
4283.65|4292.66|See, just when I left the company to go contracting, they were trying to organize a union in our company, the power company in Estevan.
4293.27|4296.61|And the organizer who sat down there, I couldn't agree with him at all.
4297.23|4300.56|All he was getting was so much for signing up.
4302.74|4307.04|And if you want $5 an hour, we'll get it for you.
4307.08|4308.16|That was his song.
4308.18|4309.32|He made lots of promises.
4309.35|4311.83|I said, "How can you give us $5 an hour?"
4311.97|4315.95|This company's having a hard time staying alive and paying us $1 an hour.
4315.97|4316.69|When would this be?
4316.79|4319.1|What year?
4321.16|4322.38|It was in 45, '44.
4322.88|4324.43|And so it was after the war.
4324.44|4324.95|Yeah.
4327.01|4330.49|And with the result of it, they never did get organized.
4330.53|4335.28|The company was taken over by the government.
4335.3|4340.95|About '46, I think, companies taken over.
4340.97|4342.99|Well, I can't think of anything else I have to ask you.
4344.09|4346.9|Unless you can think of anything else I should know.
4347.08|4349.38|It doesn't sound like the depression was that bad.
4349.68|4351.3|Listen, you can't go by Lindy.
4351.55|4374.76|i'm going to interview you too because he was one of the affluent type he doesn't tell you his mother sold the chickens for five cents a chicken all that kind of stuff that they went without food or they went without clothes and he doesn't tell you any of that stuff because he lived on a farm. He doesn't know what the depression was. But I think it was very individual type of thing the depression was -
